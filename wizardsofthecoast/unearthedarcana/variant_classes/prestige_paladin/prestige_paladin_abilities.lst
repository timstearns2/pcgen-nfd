#These abilities add the paladin spells to the appropriate class.
#Note that we actually might want to add this in a more appropriate fashion, with a chooser, but that is not possible with the current tags.
#Note that these are only the core classes, and when using sources with additional (divine casting) classes, the appropriate abilities would need to be added.
#Note that these add ALL the paladin spells. ('unique' might also mean spells only available to the paladin. In that case, the list of spells should be reduced)
#Note that these are only the spells from the RSRD (as far as I can tell)
#Note that spells added at a lower level than already present in the target class' spelllist will have no effect.(but I kept them in in case this changes.)
