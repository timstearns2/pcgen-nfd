This makes perfect sense to me.  The Conceal Thoughts 0-level power (or "spell" in PCGen terms) is almost exactly like the already-existing Conceal Thoughts 1st-level power.  Why not use copy, since it's nearly exactly the same?  For someone who isn't using the 0-level "Talents" rules, Conceal Thoughts still needs to be available as a 1st-level power.  Since the two can't have exactly the same name, the KEY: tag is needed.

If we are to use .COPY on a line by itself, and then later .MOD it, why does .COPY have the additional functionality?

If we are to make a new ability and skip the .COPY when two abilities are very close to each other, why have .COPY at all?

I removed the file; I don't know why you still saw it.  Maybe I don't know how to remove files with SVN.

I will do this.


> *_abilities_favored_class:  I'm not sure this will work as intended 'BONUS:COMBAT|AC|0.25|TYPE=Armor.STACK' did it actually work for you? If Not, I recommend 'BONUS:COMBAT|AC|BonusAstralSuitAC|TYPE=Armor.STACK' and then DEFINE:BonusAstralSuitAC|0 and BONUS:VAR|BonusAstralSuitAC|count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=Special Ability","KEY=Bonus Astral Suit AC")/4

I don't remember if I actually tested this ability.  I'm not sure why I'm getting grief for this; most, if not all, of the similar abilities in the APG don't do anything at all.  I guess I'll follow the current model and remove the attempt at functionality.

See next response.

> *_abilities_classes:
> Craftsman - This needs to be in an abilitypool, you have a CHOICE ability that is messing up a saved character due to how it was added. If you change to granting the class an Abilitypool instead that should resolve that issue.

I know I have a CHOICE ability that is messing up the saved character.  I thought I put that in the comments.
Adding an abilitypool for these items (the equipment and the craftsman ability) seems, at best, awkward.  For the item, it would mean that anyone who wants to add a new warrior's path would have to know (and remember) that the item exists, and to add a new ability for the ability pool.  For the Craftsman ability, it would mean that anyone who adds a new Craft skill would have to add a new ability; for such writers, they might not even realize that psionics exists!


> * alternate race traits:

These have (or I assumed would have) the same issue that Craftsman has above; I assumed there was already a JIRA for it since otherwise I wouldn't have recognized what was going on.  I'll see if I can track down which one it is.
