*_powers:
This makes no sense - 'Conceal Thoughts.COPY=Conceal Thoughts	KEY:Conceal Thoughts Talent'  Rinse Repeat. If you want to do something that SHOULD be
Conceal Thoughts.COPY=Conceal Thoughts Talent
Conceal Thoughts Talent.MOD  <> New Things; instead it looks like you're making an entirely new ability. Suggestion - Just make the new Ability and skip the .COPY. 

*_Equipmods is blank, why do we have a blank file?

*_equipment: Path choice could be by abilitypool as a suggestion, otherwise you'll have to code an item per path.

*_class: Split this into a 'MOD' file for the existing classes with mods.

*_abilities_favored_class:  I'm not sure this will work as intended 'BONUS:COMBAT|AC|0.25|TYPE=Armor.STACK' did it actually work for you? If Not, I recommend 'BONUS:COMBAT|AC|BonusAstralSuitAC|TYPE=Armor.STACK' and then DEFINE:BonusAstralSuitAC|0 and BONUS:VAR|BonusAstralSuitAC|count("ABILITIES","CATEGORY=Special Ability","KEY=Bonus Astral Suit AC")/4

*_abilities_classes:
Craftsman - This needs to be in an abilitypool, you have a CHOICE ability that is messing up a saved character due to how it was added. If you change to granting the class an Abilitypool instead that should resolve that issue.

* alternate race traits:
Lots of entries about having issue saving after a choose, which choose is failing and do you a JIRA for the bug?
