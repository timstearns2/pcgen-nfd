Draconic Mutagen								KEY:Alchemist Archetype ~ Draconic Alchemist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.AlchemistPoisonResistance																																																																			DEFINE:AlchemistDraconicMutagenLVL|0	DEFINE:AlchemistDraconicMutagenDuration|0	DEFINE:AlchemistDraconicMutagenDC|0	DESC:You know how to create a mutagen that you can imbibe in order to heighten your physical prowess at the cost of your personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for %1 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a DC %2 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenDC																																																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDuration|AlchemistMutagenLVL*10	BONUS:VAR|AlchemistMutagenDC|10+(AlchemistMutagenLVL/2)+INT																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.27
