Regeneration				KEY:Regeneration ~ Underground			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.ModifyHP										DEFINE:RegenerationRate|0																											DESC:You are difficult to kill while underground.																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.48	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|%1 (underground)|RegenerationRate															BENEFIT:You are difficult to kill while underground. You heal damage at %1 points per round while underground, as with fast healing, but you cannot die as long as your regeneration is still functioning (although you still fall unconscious when their hit points are below 0). Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. You can regrow lost portions of you body and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.|RegenerationRate
