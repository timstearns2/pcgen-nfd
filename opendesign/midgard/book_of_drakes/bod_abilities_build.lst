Any opponent the drake cannot see still has total concealment against the drake, and it still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a drake with blindsense. A drake with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

The creature ignores invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment, though the drake must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The drake usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Blindsight is continuous.
