Amulet of the Eye
Minor Magic Item
This silver medallion is formed into the
shape of an open eye with a sword cutting
diagonally through it. The amulet is hand
crafted by the inner circle of the Order of the
Eye, and designed specifically for its intended
owner, and no other person may take advantage
of the magical properties contained within it.
The amulet is crafted in such a way that it may
be worn on any type of garment, whether it be
cloth or metal, so that it is highly visible no
matter the circumstance.
All amulets give their owner the following
abilities:
?? Ability to locate and recognize members
of the order (observers only) within 30 feet
(the direction and distance is known).
?? +2 protection bonus to all saves against
enchantments and mind-affecting spells and
effects.
The amulet also grants one more ability to
the owner-the exact power to be determined by
the CM. It should be a minor power relevant to
the character's class or race. Some examples are
+1 concealment bonus to armor class (rogues),
+4 intuitive bonus to a skill (gnome), turn
undead as one level higher (cleric or paladin), a
druid's Trackless Step ability (elf or ranger), etc.
CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, other
