# Improved Arcane Juggle Choices
Around the World		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Around the World ~ Improved Arcane Juggle	DESC: The arcane juggler can manipulate the arcane juggle to create a circular juggling force centered on him. This gives him a +2 magical bonus to all Perform checks when attempting special juggling maneuvers as well as providing a +4 concealment bonus to armor class as the arcane juggling force and the items surround him.
Enduring Juggle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Enduring Juggle ~ Improved Arcane Juggle	DESC: Intense practice at sustaining the arcane juggle, the juggler is able to maintain the force for a greater amount of time than the norm, adding ? his Charisma modifi er to the amount of rounds he may maintain an arcane juggle before becoming fatigued.
Plane Arc			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Plane Arc ~ Improved Arcane Juggle		DESC: The arcane juggler is able to juggle items on a horizontal plane. The items juggled automatically return to his hands, bestowing a +4 to Perform (juggling) checks to impress an audience.

Titanic Juggle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Titanic Juggle					DESC: The arcane juggler may add his Charisma modifi er to his Strength score during an arcane juggle to determine his new maximum weight capacity.
Ensnare		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Ensnare							DESC: The juggler is able to surround creatures within a loop of fl ying objects. Any creature attempting to escape suffers attacks from half the items being juggled. All attack rolls are made with the same bonus to hit as the arcane juggler's full attack bonus. To ensnare a creature (or many creatures depending on the size of the creature), the arcane juggler must make a ranged touch attack. If the arcane juggler has an arcane juggle in effect, add a +4 magical bonus to the attack roll. If successful, the target is encircled by a 10-foot radius circle of fl ying objects. For a trapped creature to escape without suffering attacks from the fl ying objects, they must succeed an Escape Artist check (DC equal to 10 + arcane juggler's level + arcane juggler's Charisma modifi er).
Improved Snare	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Improved Snare					DESC: Must have the ensnare ability. This ability works the same as ensnare, except that the size of the loop is increased to a 15-foot diameter, and the Escape Artist check DC rises to 15 + arcane juggler's level + arcane juggler's Charisma modifi er). Additionally, the arcane juggler may add his Charisma modifi er to his attack roll when attempting to ensnare creatures.
#
Juggling Throw	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	KEY:Juggling Throw ~ Arcane Juggler		DEFINE:JugglingThrowBonus|0	DESC: Using this ability, the arcane juggler can throw a number of items per round equal to his number of attacks per round as long as they are being used in a juggle. Throwing items from a juggle is considered a standard action, but the arcane juggler is able to do it without incurring the normal -4 penalty for throwing objects that are normally not meant to be thrown, for example a pot. At higher levels the arcane juggler gains a bonus to his attack rolls when throwing items from the arcane juggle only. The bonus is as indicated in the column and it is not cumulative. Doing so does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and no strength bonuses apply to thrown items from a juggle.
Juggling Step	KEY:Juggling Step ~ Arcane Juggler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:Upon reaching 3rd level the arcane juggler is now able to move at up to 3/4 his speed during an arcane juggle and up to 1/2 his speed during a normal juggle no matter how many items are juggled. Moving while juggling only two items is still at 3/4 speed.
Rapid Load		KEY:Rapid Load ~ Arcane Juggler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC: You are able to build a juggling effect faster, either with the arcane juggle or without it. You may add your Charisma modifi er to your loading rate.
Arcane Door		KEY:Arcane Door ~ Arcane Juggler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DESC: While using the arcane juggle, the arcane juggler is able to step into the loop of juggled items and enter a dimension door. All the juggled items remain where he was, and do not teleport to his new location. An arcane door can only be created while an arcane juggle is in effect. The items may be anything-even as mundane an item as pebbles- but they must number 6 items total. An arcane juggler may call up a number of arcane doors per day equal to his Charisma modifi er, and may not take anyone with him unless they are actually attached to his body. The effects of the arcane door is similar to that of a dimension door spell, except that the distance available to the arcane juggler is less; only 200 ft. + 20 ft. per arcane juggler level.

	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality

# COMMENT: Not Listed in the Class Chart - Unknown When it's Gained. Email Sent to Publisher - Oct 5, 2012

Wild Empathy	SOURCEPAGE:p.85		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Wild Empathy ~ Beast Lord	DESC:A beast lord can improve the attitude of any animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The beast lord rolls 1d20 and adds his beast lord level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the beast lord and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A beast lord is unable to use this ability to influence magical beasts, and he loses the ability altogether when wearing armor or using a shield (see above).

###Block: ~ Horok Guardian
	SOURCEPAGE:p.110		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Overreaction ~ Horok Guardian
Overreaction (Ex): The horok guardian has a tendency to overreact in groups of large people, often protecting his liege with zealous fervor. He may misinterpret a situation and make a scene with his liege, (i.e., pushing him out of the way, investigating a room before entering, tasting food to check for poison, etc.). The horok must succeed a Wisdom check (DC 10) in order to not overreact at such false situations. The level of difficulty decreases by 2 for every new guardian level gained.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.111		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Thrown Weapon ~ Horok Guardian	DEFINE:HorokGuardianThrownWeaponLvl|0
Thrown Weapon (Ex): All horok guardians specialize in one thrown weapon for a quick response to threats on their employers that may be just out of reach of a melee attack. At 1st level, they gain a +1 to all attack rolls with their chosen thrown weapon. At 5th level, this accuracy bonus raises to +2, and at 9th level they gain Improved Critical with their chosen thrown weapon as a bonus feat.
		KEY:Thrown Weapon +2	
		KEY:Thrown Weapon (Improved Critical)	
	SOURCEPAGE:p.111		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Defensiveness Awareness ~ Horok Guardian	DEFINE:HorokGuardianDefensiveAwarenessLvl|0
Defensive Awareness (Ex): The horok guardian develops extraordinary senses that warn him of danger before normal people are even aware of it. At 2nd level and above, he retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flatfooted or struck by an invisible attacker (he still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized, however).

He must have the required prerequisites for all feats gained by this ability.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.118		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Lifeforce Awareness ~ Living Compass
Lifeforce Awareness (Su): The living compass has the unique ability to sense others with the potential to use the Navitus Flemen from great distances. Any single individual can be sensed a number of miles equal to the living compass' Sense Motive ranks. In order to sense someone, however, requires different skill checks depending on how the target's alignment. Good and neutral characters can be detected with a successful Sense Motive check with a base DC of 10, modified +2 for every mile the target is away from the living compass. Evil targets (dark mystics, for example) are more difficult to sense, requiring the same Sense Motive check with a +5 modifier to the base DC, followed by a successful Concentration check with the same DC and modifiers as the Sense Motive check. The ability to feel dark mystics can also be a hindrance to the living compass. If two dark mystics come within 100 yards, her direction sense does not work. She only knows that there are multiple dark mystics nearby. If three or more dark mystics are near, the living compass must make a Will save (base DC of 10 + 10 for each dark mystic) or become disoriented, suffering a -4 penalty to all attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and ability and skill checks for 1d3 rounds plus 1 round for each dark mystic within range. This effect is so damaging to a living compass that even a successful save does not negate the confusion, but only reduces the penalty from -4 to -1. Once located, the living compass can easily find her target, if she wishes, and cannot be thrown off of the trail by any means other than the target traveling outside her awareness range.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.118		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Lifeforce Senses ~ Living Compass

In addition, while spells that affect senses (i.e. blindness/deafness) may have their desired effect (she might go blind), she is not inhibited by the condition and continues to function normally.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.118		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Enhanced Lifeforce ~ Living Compass
Enhanced Lifeforce (Su): The living compass may add her living compass levels to all checks using his Navitus Flemen Sense powers, as well as adding +4 to the DC of his Navitus Flemen Sense 3 ability.

###Block:Mastermind	119
###Block:# Mastermind
High Psionia: The mastermind learns secret lore unknown to lesser psions. He gains the ability to select a special ability from among the following by permanently eliminating power points equal to the ability to manifest a power of 5th or higher level (9 or more points). The mastermind gains a new choice of High Psionia at each level.

#120
?? Manifestation Power (Ex): This special ability increases a mastermind's effective manifester level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent power variables (including how many points you can spend on a power) and for manifester level checks. This ability costs you a permanent 9 power points. This ability can be selected more than once, and changes to effective manifester level are cumulative.
?? Mastery of Elements (Su): The mastermind can alter a psionic power when manifested so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. For example, a mastermind could manifest a Breath of the Black Dragon that does sonic damage instead of acid damage, or Claw of Energy could be used with acid or sonic damage. This ability can only alter a power with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The power's manifesting time is unaffected. The psion decides whether to alter the power's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins manifesting. This ability costs you a permanent 11 power points.
?? Mastery of Shaping (Su): The mastermind can alter area and effect powers that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the power's area or effect that are not subject to the power. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable powers have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs you a permanent 11 power points. For example, the mastermind could manifest Dismiss Ectoplasm and leave a hole where his ally's astral construct stands, preventing it from being affected.
?? Mastery of Speed (Ex): The mastermind can manifest a power with but a moment's thought. The manifesting time of such a power becomes 1 swift action. The mastermind can choose nearly any power he can manifest and thereafter manifest it as a swift action. He can perform another action; even manifest another power, in the same round as he manifests such a quickened power. A power whose time to manifest is more than 1 full round cannot be quickened with this ability, and powers that are already a swift or immediate action to manifest are not affected. The manifestation cost of the chosen power is unchanged. This ability costs you a permanent 17 power points and points equal to the ability to manifest the power to be permanently quickened.
?? Mastery of Touch (Ex): The mastermind can make attacks of opportunity using any power he knows with a range of touch, if he has at least one hand free. This does not preclude the normal manifestation of a psionic power during the same round. Touch attacks of opportunity cost their normal manifestation cost. This ability costs you a permanent 15 power points. Note: This ability does not combine with Psionic Reach to give the mastermind a huge threat area (no 30 foot or 60 foot reach).
?? Mind Fire (Su): The mastermind gains the ability to channel power points into mind fire, manifesting as a bolt of raw psionic energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level) and deals 1d6 points of damage per mastermind level plus 1d6 points of damage per power level (levels are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 for 1st thru 9th levels, respectively) of the level of the power channeled to create the effect. Therefore, a 5th level mastermind that channels a 9th level power or 17 power points into psionic fire deals 14d6 points of damage to the target if it hits (such a mastermind must be at least a 17th level manifester to do this). Furthermore, a manifester of 19th level or higher can channel up to 19 power points to get an extra 1d6 of damage with this power. This ability costs you a permanent 17 power points.
?? Psionic Reach (Ex): The mastermind can use touch powers on targets up to 30 feet away. If the power requires a touch attack (melee or ranged), the mastermind must make a ranged touch attack. If selected a second time as a special ability, the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs you a permanent 13 power points. Note: In no way does this power increase the mastermind's reach for threatened area or attacks of opportunity.

Defensive Stance (Ex): When he adopts a defensive stance, a sentinel gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases his hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a guard cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to his newly improved Constitution modifier. A sentinel may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the guard is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for as many rounds as his stance lasted. A sentinel can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: Monolith Sentinel). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a sentinel can only initiate or end one during his action.

He makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. He must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute his defensive roll. If he is in a situation that would deny him any Dexterity bonus to AC, he can't attempt a defensive roll.

Pruned turning attempts do not affect undead otherwise. If a greater turning effect is used for pruning, and if the possessing creature is turned; it is instead blasted out of existence unless it is from another plane. Creatures from other planes are expelled out of the possessed creature's body and back into their home plane leaving only a black puff of smoke that is instantly gone.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.132		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Blast ~ Scarlet Rose
Blast (Su): The scarlet rose can use a greater turning effect (as the ability from the Sun domain) one more time per day at seventh level. This does not increase the number of turn attempts he normally gets per day; just one more of them can be a greater turning effect.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.132		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Abjure ~ Scarlet Rose
Abjure (Su): The scarlet rose can now tune his undead turning attempts to affect evil outsiders at ninth level. Tuning the undead attempt is a free action, but the tuned turning attempt is still a standard action. Tuned turning attempts will not affect undead unless they are also evil outsiders. Destroyed outsiders are sent back to their home plane in a puff of foul-smelling sulphur. Tuned greater turning effects have no further effect.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.132		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Burn ~ Scarlet Rose
Burn (Su): At tenth level, the scarlet rose can use a greater turning effect to blast all undead (that would normally be affected) with a holy fire that burns away their undead status (roll turning check and turning damage to see which would be affected), leaving them as very weakened, but living creatures, once per day. This uses up one of the scarlet rose's greater turning attempts for that day. All creatures affected have one hp and are exhausted until they have had at least 1 week of bed rest. Their creature type returns to what it had been before. Memories of being undead are lost, and disorientation is common for several weeks afterward. Most such creatures will be 1st level commoners unless the CM has something else in mind or the history of a certain undead is known. Liches are totally immune to this power, as are several other very powerful undead (CM's discretion). Any undead that chose to become undead (except liches) are instead blasted out of existence (like a greater turning effect) if affected by the burn. If the Burn is tuned (as by Abjure) to affect evil outsiders, only a normal abjure effect is gained.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a shakasan may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

Spiritual Strength (Su): Upon reaching 5th level, the shakasan warrior is able to draw upon strength deep from within him and deliver a deadly blow with any melee weapon he uses. Once per day the shakasan may add 3d4 x his Charisma modifier to his damage for one melee strike. Doing so leaves the warrior in a fatigued state and he temporarily loses 4 points of Strength and Constitution. This loss occurs whether he actually hits his target or not. The drained ability points fully return after 8 hours of complete rest.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.136		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Soldier's March
Troubadour's Flamboyance: The troubadour gains one ability from the following list. Each ability may be used 1/day.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.136		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Troubadour's Erudition
Troubadour's Erudition (Ex): This ability works exactly the same as the bardic knowledge ability of the bard. Troubadours who have levels in bard may add their bard levels to their troubadour levels for purposes of knowing a particular bit of information.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.136		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Calm Animals
Calm Animals (Sp): This ability is similar to a cleric's ability to turn undead, but instead of forcing affected animals to flee, it simply calms them. It only works if the creatures are not being attacked or threatened, and if it has not been attacked within the past minute by the troubadour or her allies. For every 3 rounds the troubadour uses the ability, the hostility of animals decreases by one level (for example, from Hostile to Unfriendly, or from Unfriendly to Indifferent, etc.). If the animals are attacked or approached in a threatening manner by the troubadour or her allies, or if companions of the creature are attacked, the effect is instantly broken. This ability does not allow the troubadour to command or charm animals, but merely counteract their hostility. Similar to turning undead, the troubadour can affect a number of hit dice equal to 2d6 + her troubadour level + her Cha modifier. The hit dice of the most powerful animal that she can affect depends on her Performance check result using the turn undead table for clerics, and dependant on her level. The effect lasts for 10 minutes after the troubadour has finished singing, after which time the animals react to her and her companions normally. Exceptionally intelligent animals (such as a wizard's familiar or a paladin's warhorse) are not affected by this ability, nor are magical beasts. Specially trained animals (such as guard dogs or a trained mount) are allowed a Will save with a DC of 10 + ? the troubadour's level + her Cha modifier to negate the effect.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.136		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Battle Hymn
Battle Hymn (Su): This invigorating song whips a troubadour's allies up into an almost berserk state. A number of allies up to ? a troubadour's level may be affected, where they gain a temporary +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution, as well as enjoying the benefits of a haste spell. They suffer a -1 penalty to their armor class, and they cannot flee from or cease combat until they are victorious, dead, or the hymn ends. A character who is reduced to 0 hit points while enraged does not become unconscious, but continues to fight until dead (-10 hit points). They can only cast spells if they succeed a Concentration check with a DC equal to the troubadour's Perform result. The effects of a battle hymn lasts for 1 round/ troubadour level, or until she stops singing, after which those affected suffer a -2 penalty to Constitution, Strength, and Dexterity for twice the number of rounds they were enraged. Only intelligent creatures friendly to the troubadour are affected and creatures that wish to resist the effects must make a Will save against the troubadour's Perform result. This is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.



#137
	SOURCEPAGE:p.137		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Comrade's Story
Comrade's Story (Ex): Using this ability, the troubadour can use her music or poetics to convince an otherwise unfriendly or indifferent NPC or group of NPC's that she is their countryman, and that they are really very similar. She first makes a troubadour's erudition check (DC 15) to choose an appropriate tale or song to perform. This roll is made by the CM so the troubadour does not know if she has chosen the correct song or story until she performs it. Then she must make a Perform check. If her initial troubadour's erudition check succeeded, the target NPC receives a Will save against the result of the Perform check. If the NPC fails his save, he moves to the next, more beneficial attitude. If either the troubadour's erudition check fails, or the NPC makes his saving throw, he moves to the next, less beneficial attitude. Comrade's Story is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability, and it may be used a number of times per day equal to the troubadour's Charisma modifier.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.137		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Compelling Dance
Compelling Dance (Sp): This ability is similar to the 8th level Sorcerer spell Otto's irresistible dance, but is much more limited. Unlike Otto's irresistible dance, the troubadour does not need to make a touch attack to use this ability, but rather affects all creatures (including allies) within a circle of 5 ft./troubadour level. Also, unlike the spell, creatures can negate the effect by making a Will save against the troubadour's Perform result. Creatures failing their save are compelled to dance to the troubadour's music, are only able to perform a partial action each round, and suffer a -4 to both armor class and their Ref saves. A dancing creature who attempts to cast a spell must first succeed at a Concentration check with a DC of 10 + ? the troubadour's level + her Cha modifier, or have the spell disrupted and wasted. Any time a dancing creature is damaged by a creature who is not affected, it is immediately allowed an additional saving throw to negate the effect. This additional save is given a bonus to the result equal to the damage dealt by the attack. If the troubadour uses this ability outside of combat (at a party, for example), affected creatures are unaware that they have been charmed in any way, thinking simply that they were overwhelmed by the music. Creatures hostile to the troubadour, or who have reason to be suspicious of her are allowed a Will save against her Perform result to realize that they have been charmed.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.137		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Consecrate/Desecrate Area
Consecrate/Desecrate Area (Sp): A good or evil troubadour can use her music or poetry to make an area uncomfortable for those of the opposite alignment. She must sing or recite poetry for at least 10 minutes in an area to consecrate (or desecrate) it, so that creatures of opposing alignment suffer -1 to their attack tolls and saving throws, and the DC to resist or avoid abilities used against the troubadour or her allies (i.e. spells, bardic abilities, etc.) suffers a -2 penalty. Additionally, hostile spellcasters suffer a +10% spell failure chance, even if they do not normally incur such penalties (i.e. divine spellcasters). While affected, the area radiates faintly of good or evil. This affects lasts for 5 minutes/2 troubadour levels minutes, or until the troubadour stops singing-whichever comes first. Neutral troubadours must decide upon gaining this ability whether to be able to consecrate or desecrate and area, and they may not change this unless their alignment changes through normal means.

Healing Lullaby (Sp): A troubadour can use her music, storytelling, or poetry to heal allies. Friendly creatures that hear the troubadour's lullaby and then receive a normal night's sleep rest especially peacefully and recuperate from their wounds quickly. They gain 1 hit point/ troubadour level + 1 point for every point the troubadour's Perform check exceeds 15, to a maximum of the troubadour's level + her Charisma modifier. This ability may only be used once every 24-hour period.

Induce Sleep (Sp): This ability causes all creatures not in combat who hear the troubadour's voice to fall into a deep sleep. Further, it has no effect on creatures that do not normally need sleep. All creatures within range of the troubadour's performance (5 ft./troubadour and bard level) must make a Will save equal to 10 + troubadour levels + her Cha modifier or fall asleep for a number of minutes equal to the troubadour's level. Note that even a troubadour's allies are susceptible to this effect, although they gain a +2 bonus to their saving throws if they are aware of what she is doing. Creatures aware of the troubadour when she begins to use this ability, and with reason to be suspicious of her also gain a +2 to their save. If creatures hostile to the troubadour make their saving throw, they may attempt to disrupt the effect (as with the spell enthrall). To induce sleep, the troubadour must perform for 1 minute.
	SOURCEPAGE:p.138		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		KEY:Seasoned Traveler ~ Troubadour
Stunning Performance (Sp): With this ability, the troubadour accompanies his music with bright flashes and sprays of light, harming those paying attention to him. Creatures watching the troubadour at the start of her performance (including allies) are required to make a Fort save with a DC of 10 + the troubadour's level + her Cha modifier or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures stunned are flat-footed, can only perform partial actions, and suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, armor class, and Ref saves. This ability takes 1 round for the troubadour to use. It is a magical effect (spell resistance applies) and may be used a number of times/ day equal to the troubadour's Charisma modifier.

	SOURCEPAGE:p.138		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		KEY:Troubadour's Flamboyance ~ Suppress Magic
Suppress Magic (Sp): A troubadour may use her music, poetry, or storytelling to suppress any other magical effects from being introduced to her immediate area. Her Perform result becomes a Spell Resistance for any allies within a 20 ft. radius around her, with her personal Spell Resistance being her Perform result + her troubadour levels. She can maintain this ability for a number of rounds equal to her troubadour levels, and the effect lingers for 1d4 rounds after she has stopped singing. Magical spell-like abilities, such as a medusa's petrification effect or a beholder's eyes are not suppressed by this ability. Spells active before entering the affected area are likewise not affected. Improvised Instrument (Ex): Upon attaining 3rd level, the troubadour develops an innate sense of what can be used as an instrument. She is able to use objects around her as crude instruments, suffering only a -1 penalty to her Perform checks.

Soldier's March (Su): The troubadour can inspire her allies to travel long distances at great speeds. She doubles her allies' overland movement speed without incurring penalties due to fatigue. In order to do this, she must make a Perform check every hour (DC 15 + number of previous hours spent marching), up to a number of hours equal to her troubadour levels. If the Perform check fails, the party falls to normal speeds, with fatigue rules coming into effect if they continue the forced march. This ability may be used 1/day for every 5 class levels the troubadour has, but there must be a minimum of 4 hours rest between uses.
Seasoned Traveler (Ex): The troubadour gains a +2 to all erudition checks, reflecting the fact that she has either traveled more widely than most, or that she is especially perceptive.

Close-Quarter Combat (Ex): Due to their extreme training and nightly combat in the cramped corridors and alleys of Nightwatch, two watchmen may occupy the same 5x5 ft. space and attack normally. However, due to this tight formation the watchman does not receive any bonus from Strength modifiers on his attack and damage rolls.

Stand Ground (Ex): Over time the watchmen have witnessed many unnatural creatures and done battle with them. Upon reaching 4th level, a watchman may add his Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to his saves against the frightful presence and fear qualities of undead creatures. On a successful save, if other watchmen who do not possess this ability witness the bravery of their comrades-at-arms, they are bolstered by the sight and gain a +1 morale bonus to their saving throw against the same frightful presence and fear qualities.

He changes according to the lycanthrope template, but he is not a true lycanthrope, and therefore does not suffer extra damage from specially prepared weapons. He gains additional feats and ability score increases as per the animal hybrid type (see table 3-28b below). The transformations are short lived and may last no more than 1 minute per wereranger level, after which the ranger suffers a -4 Constitution and -2 Strength penalty for 2 hours due to the strain on his body.

For example, a wereranger with the Move Silently skill and who has 6 rats in his animal pack will gain a +4 racial bonus to his Move Silently skill checks. Note that if the wereranger has more than one animal type in his pack with the same skill bonuses, the racial bonuses do not stack.

Forbidden: Wyrm masters are forbidden from knowingly touching items such as potions and wands designed for dragon control, as well as weapons that are specifically designed to harm dragons. Additionally, a wyrm master cannot deliberately injure a dragon unless the dragon has gone rogue and threatens other dragons, or has willingly and without any reason killed loyal followers of Alfheim-Rigel. Even in such extreme situations, he must first attempt to reason with it. A wyrm master who, under influence of another being hurts or kills a dragon must make amends (as decided by the CM) to prove to the dragons and himself that he was innocent. A wyrm master who is forced to kill a rogue dragon must as soon as possible cleanse himself of sin for 3 days. This rite includes hot steam baths, fasting, discussing the event with another wyrm master and prayers to Alfheim-Rigel.
