Improved Arcane Juggle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality			KEY:Improved Arcane Juggle ~ Arcane Juggler	DESC:At each even level beginning at 2nd, the arcane juggler chooses one of the following special juggling techniques.
# Improved Arcane Juggle Choices
Around the World		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Around the World ~ Improved Arcane Juggle	DESC: The arcane juggler can manipulate the arcane juggle to create a circular juggling force centered on him. This gives him a +2 magical bonus to all Perform checks when attempting special juggling maneuvers as well as providing a +4 concealment bonus to armor class as the arcane juggling force and the items surround him.
Enduring Juggle		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Enduring Juggle ~ Improved Arcane Juggle	DESC: Intense practice at sustaining the arcane juggle, the juggler is able to maintain the force for a greater amount of time than the norm, adding ? his Charisma modifi er to the amount of rounds he may maintain an arcane juggle before becoming fatigued.
Plane Arc			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Plane Arc ~ Improved Arcane Juggle		DESC: The arcane juggler is able to juggle items on a horizontal plane. The items juggled automatically return to his hands, bestowing a +4 to Perform (juggling) checks to impress an audience.
Plato-arc			CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.82	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Plato-arc ~ Improved Arcane Juggle		DESC: The arcane juggler is able to create spirals and fi gure eights with objects he juggles. These displays provide him with a +2 bonus to Perform skill checks during the performance and a +2 bonus to all Diplomacy skill checks for the next hour against those that have seen the display.
Titanic Juggle	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Titanic Juggle					DESC: The arcane juggler may add his Charisma modifi er to his Strength score during an arcane juggle to determine his new maximum weight capacity.
Ensnare		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Ensnare							DESC: The juggler is able to surround creatures within a loop of fl ying objects. Any creature attempting to escape suffers attacks from half the items being juggled. All attack rolls are made with the same bonus to hit as the arcane juggler's full attack bonus. To ensnare a creature (or many creatures depending on the size of the creature), the arcane juggler must make a ranged touch attack. If the arcane juggler has an arcane juggle in effect, add a +4 magical bonus to the attack roll. If successful, the target is encircled by a 10-foot radius circle of fl ying objects. For a trapped creature to escape without suffering attacks from the fl ying objects, they must succeed an Escape Artist check (DC equal to 10 + arcane juggler's level + arcane juggler's Charisma modifi er).
Improved Snare	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.ArcaneJugglerImprovedArcaneJuggle	KEY:Improved Snare					DESC: Must have the ensnare ability. This ability works the same as ensnare, except that the size of the loop is increased to a 15-foot diameter, and the Escape Artist check DC rises to 15 + arcane juggler's level + arcane juggler's Charisma modifi er). Additionally, the arcane juggler may add his Charisma modifi er to his attack roll when attempting to ensnare creatures.
#
Juggling Throw	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	KEY:Juggling Throw ~ Arcane Juggler		DEFINE:JugglingThrowBonus|0	DESC: Using this ability, the arcane juggler can throw a number of items per round equal to his number of attacks per round as long as they are being used in a juggle. Throwing items from a juggle is considered a standard action, but the arcane juggler is able to do it without incurring the normal -4 penalty for throwing objects that are normally not meant to be thrown, for example a pot. At higher levels the arcane juggler gains a bonus to his attack rolls when throwing items from the arcane juggle only. The bonus is as indicated in the column and it is not cumulative. Doing so does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and no strength bonuses apply to thrown items from a juggle.
Juggling Step	KEY:Juggling Step ~ Arcane Juggler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:Upon reaching 3rd level the arcane juggler is now able to move at up to 3/4 his speed during an arcane juggle and up to 1/2 his speed during a normal juggle no matter how many items are juggled. Moving while juggling only two items is still at 3/4 speed.
Rapid Load		KEY:Rapid Load ~ Arcane Juggler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary			DESC: You are able to build a juggling effect faster, either with the arcane juggle or without it. You may add your Charisma modifi er to your loading rate.
Arcane Door		KEY:Arcane Door ~ Arcane Juggler	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SOURCEPAGE:p.83	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike				DESC: While using the arcane juggle, the arcane juggler is able to step into the loop of juggled items and enter a dimension door. All the juggled items remain where he was, and do not teleport to his new location. An arcane door can only be created while an arcane juggle is in effect. The items may be anything-even as mundane an item as pebbles- but they must number 6 items total. An arcane juggler may call up a number of arcane doors per day equal to his Charisma modifi er, and may not take anyone with him unless they are actually attached to his body. The effects of the arcane door is similar to that of a dimension door spell, except that the distance available to the arcane juggler is less; only 200 ft. + 20 ft. per arcane juggler level.

Wild Empathy	SOURCEPAGE:p.85		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		KEY:Wild Empathy ~ Beast Lord	DESC:A beast lord can improve the attitude of any animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The beast lord rolls 1d20 and adds his beast lord level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the beast lord and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A beast lord is unable to use this ability to influence magical beasts, and he loses the ability altogether when wearing armor or using a shield (see above).

At 8th level, the horok guardian can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the horok guardian.

###Block:# Mastermind
High Psionia		SOURCEPAGE:p.119	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:The mastermind learns secret lore unknown to lesser psions. He gains the ability to select a special ability from among the following by permanently eliminating power points equal to the ability to manifest a power of 5th or higher level (9 or more points). The mastermind gains a new choice of High Psionia at each level.
#
Manifestation Power	SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary		DESC:This special ability increases a mastermind's effective manifester level by 1 for purposes of determining level-dependent power variables (including how many points you can spend on a power) and for manifester level checks. This ability costs you a permanent 9 power points. This ability can be selected more than once, and changes to effective manifester level are cumulative.
Mastery of Elements	SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Supernatural		DESC:The mastermind can alter a psionic power when manifested so that it utilizes a different element from the one it normally uses. For example, a mastermind could manifest a Breath of the Black Dragon that does sonic damage instead of acid damage, or Claw of Energy could be used with acid or sonic damage. This ability can only alter a power with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic descriptor. The power's manifesting time is unaffected. The psion decides whether to alter the power's energy type and chooses the new energy type when he begins manifesting. This ability costs you a permanent 11 power points.
Mastery of Shaping	SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Supernatural		DESC:The mastermind can alter area and effect powers that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, emanation, or spread. The alteration consists of creating spaces within the power's area or effect that are not subject to the power. The minimum dimension for these spaces is a 5-foot cube. Furthermore, any shapeable powers have a minimum dimension of 5 feet instead of 10 feet. This ability costs you a permanent 11 power points. For example, the mastermind could manifest Dismiss Ectoplasm and leave a hole where his ally's astral construct stands, preventing it from being affected.
Mastery of Speed		SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary		DESC:The mastermind can manifest a power with but a moment's thought. The manifesting time of such a power becomes 1 swift action. The mastermind can choose nearly any power he can manifest and thereafter manifest it as a swift action. He can perform another action; even manifest another power, in the same round as he manifests such a quickened power. A power whose time to manifest is more than 1 full round cannot be quickened with this ability, and powers that are already a swift or immediate action to manifest are not affected. The manifestation cost of the chosen power is unchanged. This ability costs you a permanent 17 power points and points equal to the ability to manifest the power to be permanently quickened.
Mastery of Touch		SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary		DESC:The mastermind can make attacks of opportunity using any power he knows with a range of touch, if he has at least one hand free. This does not preclude the normal manifestation of a psionic power during the same round. Touch attacks of opportunity cost their normal manifestation cost. This ability costs you a permanent 15 power points. Note: This ability does not combine with Psionic Reach to give the mastermind a huge threat area (no 30 foot or 60 foot reach).
Mind Fire			SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Supernatural		DESC:The mastermind gains the ability to channel power points into mind fire, manifesting as a bolt of raw psionic energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (400 feet + 40 feet/level) and deals 1d6 points of damage per mastermind level plus 1d6 points of damage per power level (levels are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 for 1st thru 9th levels, respectively) of the level of the power channeled to create the effect. Therefore, a 5th level mastermind that channels a 9th level power or 17 power points into psionic fire deals 14d6 points of damage to the target if it hits (such a mastermind must be at least a 17th level manifester to do this). Furthermore, a manifester of 19th level or higher can channel up to 19 power points to get an extra 1d6 of damage with this power. This ability costs you a permanent 17 power points.
Psionic Reach		SOURCEPAGE:p.120	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.HighPsionia.Extraordinary		DESC:The mastermind can use touch powers on targets up to 30 feet away. If the power requires a touch attack (melee or ranged), the mastermind must make a ranged touch attack. If selected a second time as a special ability, the range increases to 60 feet. This ability costs you a permanent 13 power points. Note: In no way does this power increase the mastermind's reach for threatened area or attacks of opportunity.

# TODO: (Ex): When he adopts a defensive stance, a sentinel gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in Constitution increases his hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a guard cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to his newly improved Constitution modifier. A sentinel may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the guard is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for as many rounds as his stance lasted. A sentinel can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: Monolith Sentinel). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a sentinel can only initiate or end one during his action.
