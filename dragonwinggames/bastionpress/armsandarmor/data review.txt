Any reason you used - BONUS:CHECKS|Fortitude,Reflex,Will|1|TYPE=Resistance vs. BONUS:CHECKS|ALL|1|TYPE=Resistance for the several instances of this?

TYPE=Armor.REPLACE is no longer accepted for how we have items set up for a Base AC there is no .REPLACE as it has unwanted effects for stacking vs. not-stacking.
Same with Natural Armor and any other Base Item; if it stacks, we now use .STACK

Bardic Cloak - Any reason not granting the fire resistance ability?
