Stuff below is for double checks.  I'm fixing the obvious stuff in the set as I go.
Anyone have issues with a SORUCESHORT:IntoGreen ?  ittg would make me guess a lot....
Side note: The _full picture is a flip of the picture in the cover .gif.  Intentional?  Since we aren't using Green_full.jpg, 
	do we need it in the folder?  Did I miss how it is referenced?

PCCs:  One PCC per folder...  I haven't moved it, but that needs to be done before moving into the main repository.  
	Not moved mainly because it looks like the 3.5 version stuff is incomplete.

/intothegreen/35:

_races_35e:
This looks like 3e races, even with 3.5 lines commented out.  (Old Wilderness Lore skill, etc.)

AM- Correct, incomplete, just set up for future.

_kits_35e:
None of the skills filled out.....

AM- Separate tracker when someone has time to complete. Cheat notes in place.

/intothegreen:

_equipment:
1) Assuming COST:25 on Lover's Horn and Kaleidoscope.  Bad tag syntax..  Ended with COST null, and a 25: tag at the end 
	of the line. for both.
AM- Correct, I thought I fixed that. Must have not ported.

2) Poisons: ":" in the SPROP, which can cause problems on export.  
 -- We probably need to use an ASPECT bit on these (RSRD is bad on that as well)..  Need OS / Data FReqs for that.

 AM- Something I ported direct from Barak. Agreed, we need ASPECT. Also, ':' I normally convert to '-'.

3) Do we really want "Herbalist (DC 20)" for an SPROP???  That's going a bit far.  
	I don't mind an ASPECT for those that want it, but an extra line for every item in the list for that?  Imagine 
	that on the RSRD alchemy items.

AM- Your call. Again, this was a port/merge from Barak.

4) Point of TYPE:Facegear.Mask ?  If it is TYPE:Eyegear, that's all we need.  Are we using the extra TYPEs for something?
	Same thing for Headgear.Helm ....

AM- Me trying to find the right Type (Syntax Highlighting Laziness on my part); Though if an object is a Helm or Mask, I like to include it, just in case.

_equipmods:
Missing SOURCEPAGE info.

AM- D'oh. 

_spells:
1) Will "Forest Invisibility" be getting fleshed out?  I'm assuming a PL issue there...  It would be nice to have a SOURCEPAGE 
	to the page that makes the reference....

AM- This is a Spell From another book. Not sure what the standard protocol for another book ref is.

2) Not sure we need the DESCs in a separate .MOD.  They aren't extremely descriptive, and it looks like we have pub. approval.
3) Added Spell Type.

AM - Me being a bit lazy. I had all 'DESC:See Text' and then Barak sent me his copy, which had the descriptions. So, I .MOD the spells. If you want I can simply move them over.


_abilities:
1) Missing some TIMES= parameters in SPELLS tags.  If these are 1/day, we should have it set to TIMES=1.
  -(Line 27): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=9|Awaken|Control Plants|Detect Animals or Plants|Diminish Plants|Entangle|Plant Growth|Spike Growth|Spike Stones"
  -(Line 33): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=13|Control Weather|Summon Nature's Ally VII"
  -(Line 100): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=10|Dominate Animal|Snare|Spike Growth"
  -(Line 124): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=7|Divination"
  -(Line 154): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=12|Control Weather"
  -(Line 159): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=4|Charm Person|Forest Invisibility"
  -(Line 165): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=15|Plant Growth"
  -(Line 175): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=16|Plane Shift"

AM-  PL error, default is 1 and TIMES= is not needed.

2) Missing SOURCEPAGE on all of them, it looks like.

AM- I thought standard wasn't to include Sourcepage for Race Stuff? Especially when a bunch overlap?

3) From the looks of it, some of these can be merged with the standard SRD abilies... Pounce, Improved Grab, Fast Healing, 
	Fire Vulnerability, etc.

AM- Yeah, if it was 35e I'd have done so, but 3e some things were missing. But the way I have it, allows homebrews to modify the ability. 

	Might have to clarify the Turn Resistance bit, since those aren't Turn Undead...

AM- Not sure what you mean, can you explain?

4) I haven't thoroughly checked lately the BONUS:PCLEVEL tag in a while, but last time I checked, anything above 1 caused 
	inconsistant behavior, especially on loading a character.  I recommend moving to specific Race entries for those.
	(Maakantu and Elderwitch)

AM- I'll double check, but I believe that's how the Dragons are set up in the srd35 sets.

_kits:
1) Some of the Kits are incomplete (mostly Skills stuff)

AM- Tracker for Skills in Kits. Otherwise Kits are functional to make a default creature, sans skills.

_classes: 
1) SOURCEPAGE for the Plant Fey should be for a Sidebar or the first race that uses it.  Missing in the file.

AM- I'll have to find it, the first race mentioned it is the only place I could find this new 'species'.

_templates_deseases:
1) Were we planning on adding Cold, etc. to the 3e set?

AM- I think consistency between the 3e and 35e sets would be good, especially if we're going to eventually do a Conversion set.

2) The diseases are missing a negative modifier, I think.  Diseases usually have bad effects on the characters, right?  
	Is there something esle beyond those that I'm missing?
AM- I only included the Stat Issues. Some had non-stat effects, wasn't sure if we could include the descriptions in that case.



Analysis: /35e fails Data review - none of it conforms to RSRD, and the PCC needs to get implemented in the same folder.
		Rest is mostly ready to go for Alpha releases (in /alpha).  My concern there is the incomplete Kits.
		Doesn't feel ready for a OOC.
