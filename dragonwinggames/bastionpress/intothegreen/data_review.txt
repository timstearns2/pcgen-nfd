Stuff below is for double checks.  I'm fixing the obvious stuff in the set as I go.
Anyone have issues with a SORUCESHORT:IntoGreen ?  ittg would make me guess a lot....
Side note: The _full picture is a flip of the picture in the cover .gif.  Intentional?  Since we aren't using Green_full.jpg, 
	do we need it in the folder?  Did I miss how it is referenced?

PCCs:  One PCC per folder...  I haven't moved it, but that needs to be done before moving into the main repository.  
	Not moved mainly because it looks like the 3.5 version stuff is incomplete.

/intothegreen/35:

_races_35e:
This looks like 3e races, even with 3.5 lines commented out.  (Old Wilderness Lore skill, etc.)

_kits_35e:
None of the skills filled out.....

/intothegreen:

_equipment:
1) Assuming COST:25 on Lover's Horn and Kaleidoscope.  Bad tag syntax..  Ended with COST null, and a 25: tag at the end 
	of the line. for both.
2) Poisons: ":" in the SPROP, which can cause problems on export.  
 -- We probably need to use an ASPECT bit on these (RSRD is bad on that as well)..  Need OS / Data FReqs for that.
3) Do we really want "Herbalist (DC 20)" for an SPROP???  That's going a bit far.  
	I don't mind an ASPECT for those that want it, but an extra line for every item in the list for that?  Imagine 
	that on the RSRD alchemy items.
4) Point of TYPE:Facegear.Mask ?  If it is TYPE:Eyegear, that's all we need.  Are we using the extra TYPEs for something?
	Same thing for Headgear.Helm ....

_equipmods:
Missing SOURCEPAGE info.

_spells:
1) Will "Forest Invisibility" be getting fleshed out?  I'm assuming a PL issue there...  It would be nice to have a SOURCEPAGE 
	to the page that makes the reference....
2) Not sure we need the DESCs in a separate .MOD.  They aren't extremely descriptive, and it looks like we have pub. approval.
3) Added Spell Type.

_abilities:
1) Missing some TIMES= parameters in SPELLS tags.  If these are 1/day, we should have it set to TIMES=1.
  -(Line 27): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=9|Awaken|Control Plants|Detect Animals or Plants|Diminish Plants|Entangle|Plant Growth|Spike Growth|Spike Stones"
  -(Line 33): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=13|Control Weather|Summon Nature's Ally VII"
  -(Line 100): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=10|Dominate Animal|Snare|Spike Growth"
  -(Line 124): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=7|Divination"
  -(Line 154): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=12|Control Weather"
  -(Line 159): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=4|Charm Person|Forest Invisibility"
  -(Line 165): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=15|Plant Growth"
  -(Line 175): the TIMES= parameter is missing in "SPELLS:Innate|CASTERLEVEL=16|Plane Shift"
2) Missing SOURCEPAGE on all of them, it looks like.
3) From the looks of it, some of these can be merged with the standard SRD abilies... Pounce, Improved Grab, Fast Healing, 
	Fire Vulnerability, etc.
	Might have to clarify the Turn Resistance bit, since those aren't Turn Undead...
4) I haven't thoroughly checked lately the BONUS:PCLEVEL tag in a while, but last time I checked, anything above 1 caused 
	inconsistant behavior, especially on loading a character.  I recommend moving to specific Race entries for those.
	(Maakantu and Elderwitch)

_kits:
1) Some of the Kits are incomplete (mostly Skills stuff)

_classes: 
1) SOURCEPAGE for the Plant Fey should be for a Sidebar or the first race that uses it.  Missing in the file.

_templates_deseases:
1) Were we planning on adding Cold, etc. to the 3e set?
2) The diseases are missing a negative modifier, I think.  Diseases usually have bad effects on the characters, right?  
	Is there something esle beyond those that I'm missing?


Analysis: /35e fails Data review - none of it conforms to RSRD, and the PCC needs to get implemented in the same folder.
		Rest is mostly ready to go for Alpha releases (in /alpha).  My concern there is the incomplete Kits.
		Doesn't feel ready for a OOC.
