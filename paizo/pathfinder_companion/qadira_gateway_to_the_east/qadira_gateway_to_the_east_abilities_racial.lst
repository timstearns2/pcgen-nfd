Elemental Assault								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Once per day as a swift action, a suli can call on the elemental power lurking in his veins to shroud his arms in acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Unarmed strikes with his arms or hands (or attacks with weapons held in those hands) deal +1d6 damage of the appropriate energy damage, as if using a flaming or frost weapon. This lasts for 1 round per level. The suli can dismiss the elemental power as a free action.	SOURCEPAGE:p.28
