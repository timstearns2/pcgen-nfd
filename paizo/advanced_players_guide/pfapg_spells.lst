	RANGE:medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
	TARGETAREA:two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres
	DURATION:1 round/level
	SAVEINFO:Reflex negates	SPELLRES:yes
You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction
you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an
additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th,
to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate
of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind
does not affect a flying sphere’s course.
If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving
for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to
that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the
damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a –4 penalty on
this saving throw.
Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it’s a
move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single
casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes
have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or
move solid objects. A ball lightning globe winks out if it exceeds
the spell’s range.

	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:no
With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return
a creature to its natural form. This functions as dispel magic
directed at the effect in question, except you receive a +2
enhancement bonus on your dispel check and you can only
dispel illusions or changes in form created by supernatural
effects or spells. If multiple effects are changing the creature’s
appearance, you can dispel one such effect for every four
caster levels you possess, starting with the highest caster
level spells and proceeding to spells with lower caster levels.
The caster level for supernatural abilities such as change
shape is equal to the target creature’s Hit Dice. A creature
returned to its natural form by banish seeming is prevented
from changing its form again for a number of rounds equal
to your caster level.
Banish seeming has no effect on nonmagical means of
changing appearance, such as that provided by a disguise or
extraordinary ability.

	SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:yes
You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into
using or consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its
Will save, it immediately takes the offered object, dropping
an already held object if necessary. On its next turn, it
consumes or dons the object, as appropriate for the item
in question. For example, an apple would be eaten, a potion
consumed, a ring put on a finger, and a sword wielded in
a free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept the
object, the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation
to continue consuming or using the item once the spell’s
duration has expired, although it may find a cursed item
difficult to be rid of.

saving throws equal to its Charisma bonus (if any) on all
saving throws.

You fall unconscious but also unleash a spectacular wave of holy
energy that heartens and heals your allies while leaving your
opponents daunted and damaged. You can cast this spell as
either a standard action on your turn, or as an immediate action
when brought to below 0 hit points. If cast as a standard action,
you are immediately reduced to –1 hit points, but stable, after
casting the spell.
When you cast this spell, any good creature within range
is healed for 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. All
evil creatures within range take the same amount as damage
instead (a successful Will save halves this damage). In addition,
all allies and enemies within range are affected as if by the
prayer spell for 1 round per caster level.

With this prayer you provide long-lasting succor to a wounded
creature. For as long as the effect lasts, the target receives a +2
morale bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects.
At any time while the spell is in effect, the target can choose to
end the spell as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The
target loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8 points
of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

With this blessing, you call your allies to move forth and

for the duration of this spell, each of your allies can choose one
of the following bonuses for that round at the beginning of its
turn (their choice).
• Increase its speed by 30 feet.
• Stand up as a swift action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.
• Make one extra attack as part of a full attack action, using its
highest base attack bonus.
• Gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC

• Cast a single spell of 2nd level or lower as if it were an
enlarged, extended, silent, or still spell.
These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such as
those provided by haste or a speed weapon, nor do they actually
grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell
or otherwise take an extra action in the round. Blessing of fervor
does not stack with haste.

questions appear on any flat surface you designate (a wall, a
piece of paper, and so on).
• Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most
commonly known)
• What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role)
• How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of the events that

You borrow one of the target’s known skills. After touching the

the subject’s skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability.
If you take longer than the spell’s duration to make the check
or the check requires more time, then it fails and you must use

A bow spirit is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking
ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the
bow spirit lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the bow
spirit to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the
bow spirit were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The bow
spirit uses your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier,
as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that
affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses.
A bow spirit’s attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
There must be ammunition available for the bow spirit to use,
and it expends ammunition as if used by you.
A bow spirit occupies your space, and moves with you.
It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but
dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of
cancellation affects it. A bow spirit’s AC against touch attacks
is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.

Brand etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6

mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature,
typically the head or forearm. A brand can be hidden by

You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its
innate toughness away from its own defense and toward
the amount of damage it deals with natural attacks. Each
round, as a swift action at the start of its turn, the creature
can choose to reduce some or all of its natural armor bonus
to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage rolls
for natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to
natural armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage
rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum
penalty/bonus of –5/+5 at 15th level. A creature cannot
reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this spell.
All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC
until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to
modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures
make this decision without any need for conscious thought
or reflection; even creatures with no Intelligence score can
benefit from this spell, although they always opt for the
maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any
tactical advantage they might lose.

Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or
foes alight with a glance.
As a standard action as long as this spell’s effects persist,
you may direct your burning gaze against a single creature
or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures
must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire
damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures
damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire.
Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to
quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of
fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also
save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or
object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from
burning gaze.
Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack—
foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by
meeting your gaze.

You mark several allies with a flaming rune. This rune does not
cause damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the
firebrand burns, any creature it marks is immune to damage from
any fire spell you cast. All of the target’s weapons (both natural
and manufactured) inflict +1d6 points of fire damage on a hit
(this bonus fire damage stacks with any amount of fire damage
a creature’s weapons might already inflict). At any point during
the spell’s duration, a creature bearing a firebrand can launch a
beam of fire at any target within 30 feet as a swift action. This
ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points of
fire damage. Once a creature uses its firebrand to fire a ray in this
manner, the effects of the spell end for that creature.

Firefall causes a fire to erupt into a geyser of dazzlingly bright
liquid flame. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately
extinguished. A fire larger than a 20-foot cube is only partly
extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, but a creature
of the fire subtype used as the source takes 1 point of damage
per caster level (no saving throw).
The coruscating rain of fire fills a hemispherical burst with a
radius of 60 feet. All creatures and objects in the area take 5d6
points of fire damage and catch on fire (Core Rulebook 444).
Creatures who make successful Reflex saves take half damage
and don’t catch on fire. Creatures within 120 feet of the original
fire source are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates).

This word of arcane-empowered inspiration often ensures
success of a crucial endeavor. Cast this spell when a creature
fails an attack roll or skill check. The creature gains a +2d4
competence bonus to the attack roll or skill check retroactively.
If the bonus is enough to turn the failure into a success, the

Getaway teleports you and allies you designate at the time of
casting to a predetermined location. You must initially cast
the spell at that location—all creatures affected by the spell
must be present at that time and within 30 feet of you. At any
time before the spell’s duration expires, you may trigger the
spell as a swift action. At this time, all affected creatures (or
their remains and gear) within 30 feet of you are teleported
to the location where you first cast the spell. Creatures more
than 30 feet away from you are left behind. Selected creatures
within 30 feet of you who do not wish to travel with you at that
time can simply choose not to go. You can be transported any
distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.

	RANGE:long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
	TARGETAREA:spout of boiling water filling a 5 ft. square and spraying

	DURATION:concentration + 1 round/level
	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial (see below)	SPELLRES:no
You cause a column of boiling water to spring forth from any
horizontal surface, knocking over creatures directly over it
and exposing nearby creatures to searing droplets as its spray
falls back to the ground.
Any creature entering the geyser, or occupying the square
it appears in, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid
being hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground. If
the creature fails its saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of fire
damage from the boiling water and also takes falling damage
based upon the height of the geyser (e.g., if the geyser is 50
feet tall, the creature takes 5d6 falling damage), landing prone
in a random square adjacent to the geyser. A successful saving
throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and
the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the
geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so
that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it).
This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and
does not count toward the creature’s normal movement.
In addition, the geyser sprays boiling water in a hemispherical
emanation around its square. The radius of this emanation
is equal to one-half the geyser’s height (e.g., a 50-foot geyser
has a 25-foot-radius emanation). Any creature within this area,
including yourself, takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round
as droplets of boiling water cascade on them.
You can choose to make a smaller geyser than your level
permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full
height, or if you simply want to create a spread of boiling rain
that’s smaller than what would be created by a full-height
geyser spell.

Gravity bow significantly increases the weight and density of
arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant
before they strike their target and then return them to normal
a few moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow
you are carrying when the spell is cast deals damage as if one
size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from
a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage,
but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from
a gravity bow (see page 145 of the Core Rulebook for more
information). Only you can benefit from this spell. If anyone
else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage
as normal for their size.

You conjure a sheltered grove of trees surrounding a shallow
spring. The grove appears from nowhere even in the most
barren, rocky soil regardless of season, but the spell must be
cast outside on open ground.
The area within the grove is temperate and comfortable, like
that of a tiny hut, although the grove provides no illumination
and provides no protection from the elements. The water in
the grove’s spring is clean and drinkable. Additionally, the
trees provide a variety of ripe fruit, regardless of season,
which acts as a goodberry spell for up to eight people. The
grove is warded with an alarm spell that alerts you whenever
any creature enters the area. Once the spell expires, the
grove vanishes, including all fruit, water, and other materials
from it, although any nourishment or healing gained from its
effects remains.

as a standard action, determine your approximate distance
from that area as well as the direction you must travel in
order to reach it. You cannot determine the location of the
area if you are on a different plane. The area counts as ”very

can only attune yourself to one location at a time. If you cast
the spell at another spot you lose the ability to locate your
original area.

This spell augments your diplomacies. While under the effects

check to change a creature’s attitude, taking the highest roll.
If this results in a roll low enough to reduce the creature’s
attitude by a step, that creature gets some clue that you are
manipulating it with a spell. Alternatively you can cast this
spell before making a Diplomacy check to gather information,
gaining a +5 competence bonus on the check.

This spell functions as create pit, except that the pit has the
ability to squeeze and crush any creature trapped within it and
has a maximum depth of 100 feet. Creatures who fall into the
hole take falling damage as normal. In addition, anyone within
the pit, not just those on the bottom, takes 4d6 points of
bludgeoning damage each round as the pit contracts and then
returns to its normal size (a successful Reflex save halves this
damage). The ever-shifting walls of the pit are quite difficult to

Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against
obfuscating effects, hunter’s eye greatly enhances your senses

the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the
see invisibility spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on
Perception checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment
provided by fog or mist, blur, displacement, invisibility, and similar

	DURATION:instantaneous
	SAVEINFO:none	SPELLRES:yes
You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all
creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something
it cannot push past. Against creatures and moveable objects
this stream acts as a bull rush. You can bull rush creatures of
any size, not just those one size larger than your own. Make a
combat maneuver check and apply its results to each creature
within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your
caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke
an attack of opportunity.
Against immovable objects this stream instead allows you to
make a Strength check to destroy the target. When attempting
to break an object, the stream has an effective Strength equal
to your caster level plus the ability score modifier as above. The
Break DC depends on the object you’re trying to break—page
175 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook lists several sample
Break DCs for various objects.
Hydraulic torrent extinguishes any normal fires it encounters
along its path. Magical fires are unaffected.

makes, it must roll twice and take the less favorable result. For
every five caster levels you have, the target must roll twice on an
additional d20 roll (to a maximum of five rolls at 20th level).
A target who can speak and has at least one free hand and
who is aware of the spell and its effects (such as from a Spellcraft
check to identify the spell as it is cast) can negate one reroll
by spending a move action to utter a brief prayer or good luck

Your every footstep creates aquatic plants capable of
supporting your weight and that of any creature of your size or
smaller that is following you. These lily pads only appear when
you cross water or other liquids which do not immediately
destroy plants. You can walk across these liquid surfaces
without any fear of stumbling (though if knocked prone,
dragged under, or otherwise pulled off your feet you still sink
in the liquid). For the duration of the spell, any creature of
your size or smaller can attempt to follow you by making a
DC 10 Acrobatics check every round. Each such check allows
it to move at half its normal land speed. If the creature takes
a –5 penalty on its check it can move at its normal speed.
If a creature fails an Acrobatics check, or if a creature that’s
larger than you attempts to follow, it falls through, damaging
the plants. Each time a creature falls through, all subsequent
creatures take a cumulative –5 penalty on their Acrobatics
checks when traveling across that particular stretch of plants.
As you move, the lily pads disappear behind you once you
pass beyond the spell’s range. Otherwise, they remain until

Marks of Forbiddance magically brand two creatures,
preventing them from committing violence against one
another. When you cast this spell choose one enemy and
one ally within range. Both targets become branded with
the sigil of forbiddance. Until the end of the spell’s duration,
in order for the two targets to attack one another, even with
a targeted spell, each attacker must attempt a Will save. If
the save succeeds, that target can attack the other normally.
If the save fails, the target can’t follow through with the

You reduce the amount of uninterrupted sleep or rest
creatures within the spell’s area need in order to recover
from injuries, regain spells, or other special abilities to 2
hours instead of the normal eight. In addition, if creatures
continue to sleep or rest beyond the initial 2 hours,
every additional 2 hours counts as a day of rest for
the purpose of recovering hit points, ability
damage, as well as for enduring diseases,
poisons, or other afflictions. This means
8 total hours of sleep counts as 4 days
for natural healing and for saving throws
as diseases or similar afflictions run their
course. When suffering from diseases, poison,
or other afflictions, sleepers experience
vivid dreams that help them track their
recovery. If things go poorly they can, at
any time, wake themselves up in order
to seek a better alternative. If awoken or
otherwise disturbed during this 8-hour period, creatures
may return to sleep but they no longer enjoy the benefits
of the accelerated recovery time. Creatures can only enjoy
the benefits of this spell once in any 1-week period.

With a gesture, this spell allows you to dismiss even the
foulest or most distinctive scents. When cast, the targeted
creatures or objects lose all natural and unnatural odors. A
creature under the effect of negate aroma cannot be tracked,
located, or pinpointed by the scent special quality. In
addition, this spell prevents the target creature from using
the stench special ability and similar odor-based abilities
(such as those possessed by troglodytes).
Negate aroma does not prevent the target from acquiring

When you cast this eerie
spell upon a recently slain
creature, you cause a
ghastly, spectral image
of it to rise up from
its corpse, shrieking for
vengeance before it vanishes in
a burst of unnatural light. This
phantom then unerringly seeks
out the creature that killed it, as
long as that creature is on the
same plane, and tries to slay its
killer in turn.
Only the corpse’s killer can see the
phantasmal image created by this spell. You
and any others who witness the spell’s
casting or its ultimate effects see only a
vague shape. The target first gets a Will
save to disbelieve the illusion. If that
save fails, the target must succeed
on Fortitude saving throw or take
10 points of damage per caster level
from the phantasmal image. Even if
the Fortitude save is successful, the
target takes 5d6 points of damage
+ 1 point of damage per caster
level. You know immediately if the
spell succeeded or failed to kill its target but gain no other
information, including the identity of the target of the spell.
The creature providing the corpse must have died no
more than 1 day per caster level prior to the casting of this
spell. If the creature that provided the corpse was not, in
fact, killed by another, or if the killer is dead or no longer
on the same plane, the spell fails. Phantasmal revenge makes
no moral judgments; it targets winners of fair fights just as
easily as murderers. Any given body can only be targeted by
a phantasmal revenge spell once.
