### Needs clean up
Ball Lightning
School evocation [air, electricity]; Level druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M/DF (a small iron ring)
Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Reflex negates; Spell Resistance yes
You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction
you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an
additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th,
to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate
of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind
does not affect a flying sphere’s course.
If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving
for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to
that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the
damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a –4 penalty on
this saving throw.
Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it’s a
move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single
casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes
have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or
move solid objects. A ball lightning globe winks out if it exceeds
the spell’s range.

Range touch

Duration instantaneous and 1 round/level; see text
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
With a melee touch attack you can dispel an illusion or return
a creature to its natural form. This functions as dispel magic
directed at the effect in question, except you receive a +2
enhancement bonus on your dispel check and you can only
dispel illusions or changes in form created by supernatural
effects or spells. If multiple effects are changing the creature’s
appearance, you can dispel one such effect for every four
caster levels you possess, starting with the highest caster
level spells and proceeding to spells with lower caster levels.
The caster level for supernatural abilities such as change
shape is equal to the target creature’s Hit Dice. A creature
returned to its natural form by banish seeming is prevented
from changing its form again for a number of rounds equal
to your caster level.
Banish seeming has no effect on nonmagical means of
changing appearance, such as that provided by a disguise or
extraordinary ability.

greater strategic positioning. You can move any allies within
range to any other space of your choosing within range. Those
spaces need not be in line of sight or line of effect from your
original position, but must be open locations on surfaces able
to support the creatures teleported. Except as noted above, this
spell otherwise functions as dimension door.
Beguiling Gift
School enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; Level bard

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, F (the object to be offered)
Range 5 ft.
Target one creature
Duration 1 round
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into
using or consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its
Will save, it immediately takes the offered object, dropping
an already held object if necessary. On its next turn, it
consumes or dons the object, as appropriate for the item
in question. For example, an apple would be eaten, a potion
consumed, a ring put on a finger, and a sword wielded in
a free hand. If the target is physically unable to accept the
object, the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation
to continue consuming or using the item once the spell’s
duration has expired, although it may find a cursed item
difficult to be rid of.

saving throws equal to its Charisma bonus (if any) on all
saving throws.

Saving Throw Will partial; Spell Resistance yes
You fall unconscious but also unleash a spectacular wave of holy
energy that heartens and heals your allies while leaving your
opponents daunted and damaged. You can cast this spell as
either a standard action on your turn, or as an immediate action
when brought to below 0 hit points. If cast as a standard action,
you are immediately reduced to –1 hit points, but stable, after
casting the spell.
When you cast this spell, any good creature within range
is healed for 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels. All
evil creatures within range take the same amount as damage
instead (a successful Will save halves this damage). In addition,
all allies and enemies within range are affected as if by the
prayer spell for 1 round per caster level.

With this prayer you provide long-lasting succor to a wounded
creature. For as long as the effect lasts, the target receives a +2
morale bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects.
At any time while the spell is in effect, the target can choose to
end the spell as a swift action for a burst of healing energy. The
target loses the saving throw bonus, but is healed of 1d8 points
of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

With this blessing, you call your allies to move forth and
empower them to conquer and become victorious. Each round
for the duration of this spell, each of your allies can choose one
of the following bonuses for that round at the beginning of its
turn (their choice).
• Increase its speed by 30 feet.
• Stand up as a swift action without provoking an attack of
opportunity.
• Make one extra attack as part of a full attack action, using its
highest base attack bonus.
• Gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC
and Reflex saves.

• Cast a single spell of 2nd level or lower as if it were an
enlarged, extended, silent, or still spell.
These effects are not cumulative with similar effects, such as
those provided by haste or a speed weapon, nor do they actually
grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell
or otherwise take an extra action in the round. Blessing of fervor
does not stack with haste.

Saving Throw Will negates (see text); Spell Resistance no
You learn the answers to a specific set of questions about a
creature so long as you have access to at least one drop of its
blood. You can cast this spell on the blood of the living or the
dead, but living or undead creatures are entitled to a saving
throw to resist the spell. You can cast the spell on dried or fresh
blood. Once you cast the spell the answers to the following four
questions appear on any flat surface you designate (a wall, a
piece of paper, and so on).
• Who are you? (The name by which the creature is most
commonly known)
• What are you? (Gender, race, profession/role)
• How was your blood shed? (Brief outline of the events that
caused its wound, to the best of the victim’s knowledge)
• When was your blood shed?
These answers always appear in a language you can read
even if the creature cannot speak that or any language.

making natural attacks so long as the attack deals slashing
or piercing damage. This bleed damage for each attack is
equal to one-half your caster level (limited to the creature’s

does not stack. When two or more attacks deal bleed damage,
take the worse effect.

You borrow one of the target’s known skills. After touching the
subject, you can make a single check with the chosen skill using
the subject’s skill ranks, but modified by your own key ability.
If you take longer than the spell’s duration to make the check
or the check requires more time, then it fails and you must use
your own skill ranks (if any). If the borrowed skill is a class skill
for you, you gain the +3 bonus on checks using that skill.

Bow Sp irit
School conjuration (creation); Level ranger 4
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, DF
Range personal
Target you
Duration 1 round/level
A bow spirit is a shapeless force that hovers about you, taking
ammunition from your quiver and firing it. For as long as the
bow spirit lasts, you can spend a swift action to direct the bow
spirit to fire an arrow or a bolt at a target of your choice, as if the
bow spirit were firing the necessary ranged weapon. The bow
spirit uses your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier,
as well as any bonuses and effects from feats you have that
affect ranged attacks, or bonuses from the ammunition it uses.
A bow spirit’s attacks do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
There must be ammunition available for the bow spirit to use,
and it expends ammunition as if used by you.
A bow spirit occupies your space, and moves with you.
It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but
dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of
cancellation affects it. A bow spirit’s AC against touch attacks
is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.

Brand

Brand etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6
characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The
mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature,
typically the head or forearm. A brand can be hidden by
clothing or removed by scraping it away (causing 1d6 points of
damage), though the brand returns if the damage is healed.

Brand, Great er

Saving Throw Fortitude negates; Spell Resistance yes
This spell functions like brand, except that it inflicts 1d6
points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even
temporarily. In addition, a greater brand blazes as bright as a
torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your
faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened.
Like the effects of bestow curse, a greater brand cannot be
dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes
a mark of justice.

Bristle
School transmutation; Level druid 1
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, DF
Range touch
Target one creature
Duration 1 minute/level
Saving Throw Fortitude negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes
You give a creature the ability to redirect a portion of its
innate toughness away from its own defense and toward
the amount of damage it deals with natural attacks. Each
round, as a swift action at the start of its turn, the creature
can choose to reduce some or all of its natural armor bonus
to AC and gain an enhancement bonus on all damage rolls
for natural attacks equal to that amount. The reduction to
natural armor, and thus the enhancement bonus on damage
rolls, cannot exceed 1 point per 3 caster levels, to a maximum
penalty/bonus of –5/+5 at 15th level. A creature cannot
reduce its natural armor bonus to less than 0 with this spell.
All attacks directed against the creature use its adjusted AC
until the start of its next turn, at which time it can choose to
modify its AC again or keep it at its current level. Creatures
make this decision without any need for conscious thought
or reflection; even creatures with no Intelligence score can
benefit from this spell, although they always opt for the
maximum possible reduction and bonus, regardless of any
tactical advantage they might lose.


Burning Gaze
School evocation [fire]; Level druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2
Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M/DF (eye of a mundane salamander)
Range personal
Target you
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Fortitude negates (see text); Spell Resistance yes
Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or
foes alight with a glance.
As a standard action as long as this spell’s effects persist,
you may direct your burning gaze against a single creature
or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures
must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire
damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures
damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire.
Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to
quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of
fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also
save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or
object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from
burning gaze.
Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack—
foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by
meeting your gaze.

You ask the target creature a single question. On the subject’s
next action, it must answer truthfully in the same language as
the question or take 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels

Duration 3 rounds
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
You blast several enemies with beams of fire. You may fire three
rays, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 11th
(to a maximum of five rays at 19th level). Each ray requires a
ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.
The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all
rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and
fired simultaneously.
Every round on your turn, a new ray of fire launches from
each creature who took damage from the spell in the previous
round—these new rays attack as if you fired them, but their
point of origin is the previous creature damaged. You can
choose the new targets as a free action, all of whom must be
within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of their new starting
point. This contagion of flame continues for a total of three
rounds—a creature can be struck more than once by this spell
over the course of these three rounds, although never by a ray
of fire that launches from itself.

You grant the touched creature limited protection from magical
effects that inflict damage based on the target creature’s
alignment, such as holy smite, order’s wrath, a paladin’s smite
evil attack, or an unholy weapon. Choose one alignment type:
chaos, evil, good, or law. The subject takes 5 less points of
damage from effects that specifically harm creatures of that
alignment. The value of the protection increases to 10 points
at 7th level and 15 points at 11th level. The spell protects the
recipient’s equipment as well.
Corruption resistance protects against spells, spell-like abilities,
and special abilities, not physical attacks. Corruption resistance
