#COMMENT: Variant Channeling should be available to some (but not all) other 
#COMMENT:   classes with a channel energy ability.  This is tricky to 
#COMMENT:   implement, since (1) paladins and clerics treat the channel
#COMMENT:   energy ability differently, and (2) one could have a character
#COMMENT:   with both cleric and paladin classes, and two different variant
#COMMENT:   channelings.
