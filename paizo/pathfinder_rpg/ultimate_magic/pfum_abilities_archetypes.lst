# Broodmaster
Eidolon Brood	KEY:Eidolon Brood ~ Broodmaster		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:You summon two Small eidolons to your side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a standard summoner.
Brood Link		KEY:Brood Link ~ Broodmaster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You form a close bond with your eidolons. This ability works like the standard summoner life link ability, except you can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If two or more eidolons in the brood take enough damage to send them back to their home plane, you can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one of them.
Larger Brood	KEY:Larger Brood ~ Broodmaster		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 8th level, you can spend 4 evolution points from the evolution pool for the large evolution; unlike with other evolutions, you spend these 4 points before assigning evolution points to your individual eidolons (for an 8th-level broodmaster with 11 evolution points, This leaves 7 evolution points to distribute among the eidolons). This allows you to summon two Medium eidolons, four Small eidolons, or one Medium eidolon and two Small eidolons. At 13th level, if you has purchased the large evolution for your brood, you can spend an additional 6 evolution points from the evolution pool for the huge evolution, distributing the remaining points among your eidolons. This allows him to call two Large eidolons, four Medium eidolons, eight Small eidolons, or any similar combination in which two smaller eidolons count as one eidolon of one size larger.
Brood Bond		KEY:Brood Bond ~ Broodmaster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 14th level, a summoner’s life becomes linked to your brood. This functions as the life bond ability, except you can only transfer damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If that eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, all excess damage remains with you, killing you.
Merge Forms		KEY:Merge Forms ~ Broodmaster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can only merge with one eidolon in the brood at a time.
