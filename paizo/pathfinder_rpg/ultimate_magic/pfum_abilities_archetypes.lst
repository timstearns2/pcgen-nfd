# Broodmaster
Eidolon Brood	KEY:Eidolon Brood ~ Broodmaster		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:You summon two Small eidolons to your side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a standard summoner.
Brood Link		KEY:Brood Link ~ Broodmaster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You form a close bond with your eidolons. This ability works like the standard summoner life link ability, except you can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If two or more eidolons in the brood take enough damage to send them back to their home plane, you can only sacrifice hit points to prevent damage to one of them.
Larger Brood	KEY:Larger Brood ~ Broodmaster		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 8th level, you can spend 4 evolution points from the evolution pool for the large evolution; unlike with other evolutions, you spend these 4 points before assigning evolution points to your individual eidolons (for an 8th-level broodmaster with 11 evolution points, This leaves 7 evolution points to distribute among the eidolons). This allows you to summon two Medium eidolons, four Small eidolons, or one Medium eidolon and two Small eidolons. At 13th level, if you has purchased the large evolution for your brood, you can spend an additional 6 evolution points from the evolution pool for the huge evolution, distributing the remaining points among your eidolons. This allows him to call two Large eidolons, four Medium eidolons, eight Small eidolons, or any similar combination in which two smaller eidolons count as one eidolon of one size larger.
Brood Bond		KEY:Brood Bond ~ Broodmaster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 14th level, a summoner's life becomes linked to your brood. This functions as the life bond ability, except you can only transfer damage to one eidolon in the brood at a time. If that eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, all excess damage remains with you, killing you.
Merge Forms		KEY:Merge Forms ~ Broodmaster			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can only merge with one eidolon in the brood at a time. 

# Evolutionist Abilities
Mutate Eidolon	KEY:Mutate Eidolon ~ Evolutionist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can change your eidolon's evolutions as if you had gained a level. To mutate your eidolon, you must perform an arcane ritual that requires 24 hours of uninterrupted concentration and costs %1 gp in material components.|classlevel("Summoner")*200
Evolve Base Form	KEY:Evolve Base Form ~ Evolutionist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Whenever you gain a level, you can change your eidolon's base form to a new base form. Once chosen, this base form is set until you gain another summoner level. 
Transmogrify	KEY:Transmogrify ~ Evolutionist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You can cast transmogrify as a spell-like ability once per day without the need for a material component. This ability has a casting time of 1 minute. 

# Master Summoner
Lesser Eidolon	KEY:Lesser Eidolon ~ Master Summoner	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DEFINE:EidolonLevel|0		BONUS:VAR|EidolonLevel|max(1,classlevel("Summoner")/2)	DESC:You possess the ability to summon a powerful outsider called an eidolon. You always summon an aspect of the same creature. Your eidolon has your alignment and can speak all of your languages. Your eidolon is treated as a summoned creature, except that it is not sent back to its home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to you, your eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. You can summon your eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, your eidolon's hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if your eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. Your eidolon remains until dismissed (a standard action). If your eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to damage, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. Your eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally.

You can use this ability when his eidolon is summoned. Only one summon monster spell may be in effect while the eidolon is summoned. If your eidolon is not summoned, the number of creatures that can be summoned with this ability is only limited by its uses per day.|SMLevel|SMTimes|SMDuration	ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|SMTimes	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per day

# Synthesist
Fused Eidolon		KEY:Fused Eidolon ~ Synthesist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:A synthesist summons the essence of a powerful outsider to meld with his own being. Instead of appearing as a separate creature next to the summoner, the eidolon appears around the synthesist, so that the synthesist seems to be inside a translucent image of his eidolon. The synthesist directs all of the eidolon's actions while fused, perceives through its senses, and speaks through its voice, as the two are now one creature. While fused with his eidolon, the synthesist uses the eidolon's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), but retains his own mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). The synthesist gains the eidolon's hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is sent back to its home plane. The synthesist uses the eidolon's base attack bonus, and gains the eidolon's armor and natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. The synthesist also gains access to the eidolon's special abilities and the eidolon's evolutions. The synthesist is still limited to the eidolon's maximum number of natural attacks. The eidolon has no skills or feats of its own. The eidolon must be at least the same size as the synthesist. While fused, the synthesist counts as both his original type and as an outsider for any effect related to type, whichever is worse for the synthesist. Spells such as banishment or dismissal work normally on the eidolon, but the synthesist is unaffected. Neither the synthesist nor his eidolon can be targeted separately, as they are fused into one creature. The synthesist and eidolon cannot take separate actions. While fused with his eidolon, the synthesist can use all of his own abilities and gear. In all other cases, this ability functions as the summoner's normal eidolon ability (for example, the synthesist cannot use his summon monster ability while the eidolon is present). 
Fused Link			KEY:Fused Link ~ Synthesist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The synthesist forms a close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the temporary hit points from his eidolon would be reduced to 0, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of his own hit points. Each hit point sacrificed this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon (thus preventing the loss of the summoner's temporary hit points), preventing the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. 
Shielded Meld		KEY:Shielded Meld ~ Synthesist		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Whenever the synthesist is fused with his eidolon, he gains a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws.
Maker's Jump		KEY:Maker's Jump ~ Synthesist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike	DESC:Whenever the synthesist is fused with his eidolon, the synthesist can cast dimension door as a spell-like ability using his caster level. This ability only affects the fused synthesist and eidolon. The synthesist can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every six levels beyond 6th. 
Greater Shielded Meld	KEY:Greater Shielded Meld ~ Synthesist	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Whenever the synthesist is fused with his eidolon, he gains a +4 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +4 circumstance bonus on his saving throws.
Split Forms			KEY:Split Forms ~ Synthesist			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a swift action, the synthesist and his fused eidolon can split into two creatures: the synthesist and the eidolon. Both have the same evolutions. The synthesist emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if possible. All effects and spells currently targeting the fused synthesist-eidolon affect both the synthesist and the eidolon.  The synthesist can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a full-round action. For the duration of this effect, the eidolon functions as a normal eidolon of the summoner's class level.
