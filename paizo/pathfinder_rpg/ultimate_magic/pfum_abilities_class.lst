Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.

This arcane pool has %1 points. The pool refreshes once per day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +%2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.|MagusArcanePool|MagusArcanePoolBonus	DESC:These bonuses can be also used to add any of the following weapon properties: Dancing, Flaming, Flaming Burst, Frost, Icy Burst, Keen, Shock, Shocking Burst, Speed, or Vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends.|PREVARGTEQ:MagusArcanePoolLVL,5																																																												BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePool|max(floor(MagusArcanePoolLVL/2),1)+INT	BONUS:VAR|MagusArcanePoolBonus|min(1+((MagusArcanePoolLVL-1)/4),5)	SOURCEPAGE:p.9		ASPECT:CheckCount|%1|MagusArcanePool	ASPECT:CheckType|Uses per Day	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(%1/day)|MagusArcanePool
Cantrips			KEY:Cantrips ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																				DESC:You can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day.

Spell Combat		KEY:Spell Combat Output			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the offhand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with ypur melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action  (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.																																																																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.10
Spellstrike			KEY:Spellstrike ~ Magus			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary																		DESC:Whenever you cast a spell with a range of "touch" from the magus spell list, you can deliver the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon's critical range (20, 19-20, or 18-20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals x2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.

Knowledge Pool		KEY:Knowledge Pool ~ Magus		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural																		DESC:When you prepare your magus spells, you can decide to expend 1 or more points from your arcane pool, up to your Intelligence bonus. For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepares spells, you lose those spells. You can also cast spells added in this way using your spell recall ability, but only until you prepares spells again.

The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. Furthermore, instead of recalling a used spell, as a swift action you can prepare a spell of the same level that you have in your spellbook. You do so by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). You cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared in this way. You do not need to reference your spellbook to prepare a spell in this way.

As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon without penalty. You can also cast any spell with a casting time of 1 standard action from the magus spell list. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks if you have more than one attack.

The ooze is not under your control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature.  The ooze remains for %1 rounds, and decays into powder when the duration expires.  If you have the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen.

Cognatogen				KEY:Discovery ~ Cognatogen				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural																																																					DESC:You gain the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score.  If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime you would prepare a mutagen, you may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance-you can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in your possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.

As a full-round action, you may shift your consciousness from your current body to any one of your available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, you transfer to your own body automatically; if killed in your own body, you are dead. Unused simulacra (including your abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses, though they do not decay. Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and requires 1 week to grow.

You treat your Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage kills you.  Reducing you to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes you unconscious and comatose, but you are only killed after taking an additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, you must be brought to -5 Constitution in order to be killed by these attacks).

Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within your body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial arm discovery, though you can manifest or hide the twin as a standard action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to you, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if you succumb to a mental effect that would make you unconscious, helpless, or not in control of your own actions (such as charm person, feeblemind, or hold person), you can reroll your saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and you can ignore it. Using this ability sickens you for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and you cannot use the twin's limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial limbs) continue normally.

The tentacle can manipulate or hold items as well as your original arms can (for example, allowing you to use one hand to wield a weapon, the tentacle to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb).

As a standard action, you can have the tumor detach itself from your body as a separate creature vaguely resembling a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (bat, cat, and so on) and move about as if it were an independent creature. The tumor can reattach itself to you as a standard action. The tumor has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on your caster level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to an alchemist). The tumor acts as your familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the Alertness feat, and so on). When attached to you, the tumor has fast healing 5. Your extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

SOURCEPAGE:p.21	BENEFIT:This haunting melody teases at the veils of understanding and drills into the bedrock of truth. Upon completing this performance, the target attempts a Will save (DC %1). Failure means you understand the target's primal nature; you gain a +4 bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence the target, and the DCs of your abilities and spells that would influence the creature or its actions (including charm and compulsion effects) increase by +2. These bonuses last for 1 day. You must have an idea of who the creature is when you begin to play the song, either through researching the creature or by observing it directly from no farther than 100 feet.

When using this masterpiece, you take a -%1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you must make a concentration check to cast any spell (DC 15 + the spell's level), but you gain a +%1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. You can combine this masterpiece with fighting defensively and Combat Expertise, but not total defense. When you use this masterpiece, it lasts until the start of your next turn. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide ) affect this masterpiece; this allows you to get multiple rounds of its benefit (and its penalties) at the cost of only 1 round of bardic performance.

Depths of the Mountain				KEY:Masterpiece ~ Depths of the Mountain				OUTPUTNAME:The Depths of the Mountain			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your drumming skills can break solid rock.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.22	BENEFIT:Like a singer shattering a wine glass with a perfect note, your music cracks stone, shivering solid rock until it snaps. When you complete the performance, you create a tremor identical to an earthquake spell. For each round you continue to expend bardic performance rounds, the area experiences a round-long aftershock, which has the following effects.  Caves, Caverns, or Tunnels: Smaller collapses cause 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 5 half) and pin any creatures caught inside.  Cliffs: More cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels half as far horizontally as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 5 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble.  Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 5 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%% chance of falling into one (Reflex DC 10 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 20 feet deep, and these fissures remain open at the end of the quake.  Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned by the effects of the aftershock takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 5 Constitution check or take 1d3 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.  Rivers, Lakes, or Marshes: The area drained away by the earthquake remains drained for the duration of the aftershock.  Spellcasting: The concentration DC to cast during an aftershock is 15 + the spell's level.  Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 50 points of damage. A collapsing structure deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures inside it (Reflex DC 5 half), and the creatures inside are pinned beneath the rubble.  Use: 10 rounds of bardic performance, +1 round for each round of aftershocks.  Action: 10 full rounds.

In desperation, Gorroc bargained with a devil, who blasted the earth with salt and withering heat, leaving the fertile land desolate for a century. When you complete the performance, you can create a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line that is blasted with scorching air and hot salt. Plants and oozes in this area take %1d%2 points of damage; half this damage is fire damage, half is piercing damage. A Reflex save (DC %3) reduces the damage by half. Creatures other than plants or oozes take half damage, or no damage on a successful save.  Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.

House of Imaginary Walls			KEY:Masterpiece ~ House of Imaginary Walls			OUTPUTNAME:The House of Imaginary Walls			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC|10+(classlevel("Bard")/2)+CHA																		DESC:You can trap opponents with the power of your acting.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:You silently mime building an invisible wall, flattening your hands along linear planes to indicate its location and orientation. This "wall" is only real for creatures that see you perform this masterpiece (Will negates, DC %1); you and your allies may automatically fail your saves if you want to treat the wall as real (for example, if you want to use the wall as a bridge to cross a chasm). For creatures who believe the wall is real, it has hardness 8, 90 hit points, and a break DC of 30 (multiple believing creatures can attack the walls, breaking through it more quickly as if they were all attacking a real wall rather than each attacking separate mental constructs). This is an illusion (phantasm) effect. Because the wall is a mental image, it blocks incorporeal creatures that fail their saves (because they perceive it as a magical barrier that excludes them), though they can still go around the wall or through the floor or ceiling to bypass it. It does not affect objects or creatures immune to mental effects (which can result in situations like an archer firing through the wall but unable to physically cross it). You can create one 10-foot-square wall per use of this ability; over several rounds you can extend this square or create other walls, all of which persist until you stop using bardic performance rounds to sustain them. The wall is immobile once created. Part of the wall must be in or along the edge of your space, and you cannot create a wall that extends beyond your natural reach (though you can create a wall, move, and create another by using this ability again). Once created, the wall exists until you end your performance or affected creatures "break" it. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide) affect this masterpiece.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.  Action: 1 standard action per 10-foot square.|HouseOfImaginaryWallsDC
Legato Piece on the Infernal Bargain	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Legato Piece on the Infernal Bargain										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your skilled playing can conjure up supernatural servants.																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:This fast-paced tune harmonizes with the magical frequencies of another plane, allowing you to draw an extraplanar creature to you and bargain for its service. When you complete this performance, you call one or more outsiders as if using planar ally. Unlike with planar ally, the creature is not necessarily associated with your deity, and has an initial attitude of "indifferent" toward you. Because it is intrigued by your performance, it remains for up to 1 minute to hear the service you are requesting and the payment you are offering. If you succeed at an opposed Charisma check against the creature (with a +0 to +6 bonus on your roll based on the nature of the service and the offered reward), it agrees to perform the service. This ability otherwise works like planar ally. Though the best-known version of this masterpiece refers to an infernal bargain, it can be used to conjure any sort of extraplanar creature (such as an archon, elemental, or protean). Other versions and arrangements of this masterpiece may have different names but otherwise identical effects.  Use: 10 bardic performance rounds.  Action: 10 minutes.

Unlike the spell (which affects weaker creatures first), this masterpiece targets a specific creature of your choice. Although this lullaby does have words, it is not a language-dependent effect.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.  Action: 1 round.|LullabyOfEmberTheAncientDC

SOURCEPAGE:p.23	BENEFIT:As ivy climbs walls and spills across even the rockiest and most uneven of terrain, so too does your dance propel you across broken stone and up walls. As long as you maintain the performance, whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain; this allows you to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain. As long as you move laterally at least 10 feet, you may climb as if you had a climb speed equal to your base speed. You may spend the first round of this performance demonstrating the dance to up to %1 creatures; if these students succeed at a DC 15 Perform (dance) check, they also gain the benefits of this masterpiece as long as you maintain the performance.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.  Action: 1 full round.|MinuetOfTheMidnightIvyTargets

SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You create a musical tempo that first mirrors your enemies' heartbeats, and then quickens them to dangerous levels. When you complete the performance, all enemies within 30 feet who can hear your performance must save (DC %1) or take 1d6 points of damage as their pounding heart causes them to sweat blood. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are unaffected by this ability. Each round that you continue the performance adds another round to the bleed effect. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance; see page 164 of the Advanced Player's Guide) affect this masterpiece.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of bleed.  Action: 1 standard action.|QuickeningPulseDC

SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next hour. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to perform a nonmagical action that normally requires a move action or a standard action. For example, you could make a full attack, then spend a swift action to take a normal move, load a light crossbow, or draw a weapon in the same round. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your speed (such as haste) or alter time (such as time stop). Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance, and you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each ally other than yourself whom you want to gain the ability to accelerate time (for example, affecting yourself and five others requires expending 11 rounds of bardic performance). This is a language-dependent effect.  Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional person affected.  Action: 1 minute.
Stone Face						KEY:Masterpiece ~ Stone Face															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:Your antics can soften even the hardest visage.																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:You tell an old and humorous tale about a woman who refused to smile at anything, no matter how funny. Through a series of increasingly unlikely events involving a cart of horse manure, a king, and a flying carpet, her legendary frown broke at last. When you complete the performance, the target is affected by stone to flesh.  Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.  Action: 1 minute.
Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre	KEY:Masterpiece ~ Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:ToccataAndFugueOfTheDanseMacabreTargets|classlevel("Bard")																		DESC:Your spooky music blurs the boundaries between life and death, confusing the senses of undead creatures.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.24	BENEFIT:The complex notes and layered repetitions of this masterpiece bring to mind the countless dead of ages past and suffuse those who listen to it with a subtle melancholia and grim acceptance of the temporary nature of life. Starting with a trio of notes, repeated frequently and with ever-greater insistence, it becomes a whirling, head-spinning vortex of sound. Upon completing the performance, you and up to %1 allies within listening range become hidden from undead, as if under the effects of a hide from undead spell. As with hide from undead, one creature breaking the effect ends the benefit of the performance for all recipients. But by spending an additional round of bardic performance when you perform or maintain the masterpiece, you can dedicate a refrain to a particular ally; even if one ally breaks the hide from undead effect, the ally receiving the dedication remains hidden so long as he does not break the effect himself. You can dedicate a refrain multiple times in the performance (up to once per round) as long as you spend 1 round of bardic performance each time for the ally receiving a dedication.  Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of the performance, +1 round per ally affected, +1 round per dedicated refrain.  Action: 1 minute.|ToccataAndFugueOfTheDanseMacabreTargets
Triple Time						KEY:Masterpiece ~ Triple Time															CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece	DEFINE:TripleTimeTargets|classlevel("Bard")																					DESC:Your lively cadence puts a spring in the step of weary marchers.																													BONUS:MOVEADD|TYPE.Walk|10|PREAPPLY:ANYPC										SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:This bright and spritely tune mimics the sound of human feet, slowly building to a steady, ground-eating pace. When you complete this performance, you affect %1 allies in hearing range. This masterpiece increases the affected target's base land speed by 10 feet for 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).  Use: 1 bardic performance round.  Action: 1 minute.|TripleTimeTargets
Winds of the Five Heavens			KEY:Masterpiece ~ Winds of the Five Heavens			OUTPUTNAME:The Winds of the Five Heavens			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Masterpiece																													DESC:You control the wind by telling a tale demonstrating the hubris of mortals.																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.25	BENEFIT:This short monologue tells the story of a village priest who thought to command the gods. This so annoyed the gods of the weather that they gave him exactly what he wished for, and the priest's long-winded sermons tore apart his temple and scattered his parishioners. When you complete the performance, you conjure a great wind as if you had cast control winds.  Use: 3 bardic performance round.  Action: 3 full rounds.

The number of supernatural scars the witch can maintain at once is %1; once she reaches this limit, she must remove the scar from a current victim in order to mark another. Effects that remove curses can remove the scar. Scarring a creature with the hex has two benefits: the witch can use any of her hexes on that creature at a range of up to one mile, and the witch is considered to have a body part from the target for the purpose of scry and similar divinations.|INT
Swamp Hag				KEY:Swamp Hag ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex																																																															DESC:While traveling through swamps, mires, bogs, and similar terrain, the witch leaves no trail and cannot be tracked, as the trackless step druid ability. The witch can walk through mud and even quicksand as if it were normal ground.
Unnerve Beasts			KEY:Unnerve Beasts ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																																																															DESC:The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become distraught and aggressive in the victim's presence-horses buck, dogs snap and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts for %1 hours. A creature that saves against the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind affecting charm effect, but the hex on the target is not.|INT
Water Lung				KEY:Water Lung ~ WitchHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																																																															DESC:An air-breathing target can breathe water or an aquatic target can breathe air. This lasts 1 minute. If the witch uses this hex on herself, she can maintain it while she sleeps, allowing her to safely sleep underwater.

## Major Hexes
Major Hex - Beast Eye		KEY:Beast Eye ~ WitchMajorHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:The witch can project her senses into an animal within 100 feet, sensing whatever it senses. She cannot control the animal's actions. She can project her senses from that animal to another within 100 feet of it as a standard action, and can continue to make these sensory leaps, potentially viewing things very far from her actual location. She may return her senses to her own body as a free action. Normal animals get no saving throw against this ability, but animal companions, paladin mounts, and similar unusual animals may resist with a Will save; the witch may use this ability on her own familiar as if it were an animal. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet of her who also have the coven hex can see through this animal at will, although the acting witch still controls the ability. The witch can use this ability for %1 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.|WitchLVL
Major Hex - Cook People		KEY:Cook People ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex		PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Cauldron ~ WitchHex									PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:The witch can create fabulous spells by cooking an intelligent humanoid creature in her cauldron, either alive or dead. Using this hex creates one meal or serving of food of the witch's choice, typically a delicious stew or a dough suitable for cookies, pastries, or other desserts. Cooking the victim takes 1 hour. Eating the food provides one of the following benefits for 1 hour: age resistance*, bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, neutralize poison (instantaneous) owl's wisdom, remove disease (instantaneous). Alternatively, the witch can shape the dough into a Small, humanlike creature, animating it as a homunculus for 1 hour. Using this hex or knowingly eating its food is an evil act.
Major Hex - Hidden Home		KEY:Hidden Home ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:The witch can conceal or disguise her home and the area around it as if using mirage arcana. Before using the hex, she must spend 1 day pacing out the border of an area that measures roughly 40,000 square feet (approximately 200 feet by 200 feet) to define her home territory. Thereafter, she can use the hex to change the appearance of that area as a standard action as long as she is within the area. The illusion persists until the witch changes or dismisses it. For the purpose of this ability, a witch can only have one "home" at a time.
Major Hex - Hoarfrost		KEY:Hoarfrost ~ WitchMajorHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work their way into its flesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and blue, and takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies, saves (once per minute), or is cured. Break enchantment, dispel magic, remove curse, and similar spells end the effect. If the target saves, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.
Major Hex - Ice Tomb		KEY:Ice Tomb ~ WitchMajorHex			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:A storm of ice and freezing wind envelops the target, which takes 3d8 points of cold damage (Fortitude half ). If the target fails its save, it is paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the ice lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the creature, which is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released. Whether or not the target's saving throw is successful, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.
Major Hex - Infected Wounds	KEY:Infected Wounds ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:The target's wounds become infected (Fortitude negates). The target takes 1 point of Constitution damage per day. After the first day, the target may save once per day to cure the infection. This is a disease effect.
Major Hex - Speak in Dreams	KEY:Speak in Dreams ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:The witch can contact a creature as if using dream. The witch can use this ability on %1 creatures per day, but can dream-speak to those creatures as often as desired throughout that time period.|INT
Major Hex - Witch's Brew	KEY:Witch's Brew ~ WitchMajorHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.WitchHex	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Cauldron ~ WitchHex									PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,10																																								DESC:When the witch uses her cauldron to brew a potion, she may spend double the cost to create 2 identical potions that day instead of just 1. At 15th level, she may spend triple the cost to create 3 identical potions that day.

## Grand Hexes
Grand Hex - Dire Prophecy	KEY:Dire Prophecy ~ WitchGrandHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18																																								DESC:The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a -4 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty of %1 to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day. This is a curse effect.|WitchLVL
Grand Hex - Summon Spirit	KEY:Summon Spirit ~ WitchGrandHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Spelllike.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18																																								DESC:The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.
Grand Hex - Witch's Hut		KEY:Witch's Hut ~ WitchGrandHex		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.WitchHex																				PREVARGTEQ:WitchLVL,18																																								DESC:The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as "follow me from 100 feet away"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state.
