If the second attempt fails, you can make no further attempts to target that creature with the same hex for 1 day.
Advanced Ranger Trap			TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trap ~ Ranger											PRECLASS:1,Ranger=5																																																																																																																																																							DESC:Your ranger traps are especially difficult to notice and avoid.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:Add +1 to the Difficulty Class on all Perception and Disable Device skill checks to find or disable the traps you make with your trap class feature. Add a +1 to the Difficulty Class on all saving throws against the effects of the trap you make with your trap class feature.
Antagonize					TYPE:General																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:Whether with biting remarks or hurtful words, you are adept at making creatures angry with you.																																																																																																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:You can make Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to make creatures respond to you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Wisdom modifier. The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Blighted Critical				TYPE:Critical																								PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5																																																																																																																																																						DESC:With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.

ADDSPELLLEVEL:2																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2 × the spell’s actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell’s descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect. A burning spell uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

A concussive spell causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A concussive spell only affects spells with the sonic descriptor. A concussive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you may add one casting of consecrate or desecrate as part of the item crafting process. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast consecrate or desecrate, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell’s area.
Create Sanguine Elixir			TYPE:ItemCreation																								PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=3			PREFEAT:1,Brew Potion																																																	PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=12																																																						PRESTAT:1,CHA=15																																				DESC:You can condense a fraction of your bloodline’s power into a powerful elixir.																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.
Defending Eidolon				TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Shield Ally																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:You have trained your eidolon to protect you.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Whenever you are adjacent to your eidolon, you can choose for the eidolon to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your eidolon’s base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your eidolon is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your eidolon’s next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the eidolon, whichever occurs f irst.
Deny Death												PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Ki Pool																		PREFEAT:1,Endurance																																																																																																																																																	DESC:Your ki is so strong that it can deny death.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:As long as you have 1 ki point in your ki pool, when you fail your Constitution check to stabilize, you do not lose 1 hit point. If you succeed at the check, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 1d6 hit points. If you roll a natural 20 on the check to stabilize, you can spend 1 ki point to heal 2d6 hit points of damage instead.
Detect Expertise				TYPE:General																																																																																								PRESPELL:1,Detect Chaos,Detect Evil,Detect Good, Detect Law,Datect Magic																																								PRESTAT:1,INT=13																																				DESC:You can detect the mystic specialty of a foe.																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you use any of the spells listed in this feat’s prerequisites to detect a creature’s alignment or its magic, you have a chance of detecting what spellcasting expertise it has. After you observe a creature with the detect spell for 3 rounds, it must make a Will save (DC %1). If it fails the saving throw, you learn what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to the effects of this feat for 24 hours.|10+CASTERLEVEL+INT
Die for Your Master			TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Tumor Familiar																																																																																																																																																																					DESC:Your tumor familiar goes to any length to save your life.																																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT: If your tumor familiar is attached, and you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the familiar throws itself in the way of the attack as an immediate action. If it makes a Ref lex saving throw (DC = damage dealt), it takes all the damage from the attack. If it fails, it takes half damage and you take half damage. The familiar must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to use this ability, and it can only do this once per day—if it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, it can’t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow the familiar to make a Ref lex save for half damage, its improved evasion ability does not apply on this saving throw.
Divine Interference			TYPE:General																								PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER.Divine=10																																																																																																																																																					DESC:You can convert a spell to interfere with an enemy’s attack.																																																																																																																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:As an immediate action, when an enemy within 30 feet hits an ally with an attack, you can sacrifice a prepared divine spell or (if you are a spontaneous caster) an unused spell slot and make the enemy reroll the attack roll. The second attack roll takes a penalty equal to the level of the spell you sacrifice. You must sacrifice a spell of 1st-level or higher to use this ability. Whether or not the second attack is successful, you cannot use this effect on the same creature again for 1 day.
Dragonbane Aura				TYPE:General					PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Aura of Courage											PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=8																																																																																																																																																						DESC:Those within your dragonbane aura gain the same protection that you do.																																																																																																																																														SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When fighting dragons, your aura of courage expands to a 20-foot-radius emanation, and allies in the aura gain a morale bonus on saving throws against dragon breath equal to your aura of courage’s bonus against fear effects.
Echoing Spell				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																																																																																																																																		DESC:You have learned how to release most, but not all, of a spell’s potential when you cast it.																																																																													ADDSPELLLEVEL:3																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When you cast an echoing spell, it does not disappear entirely from memory, and you can cast it one additional time during that day. If you prepare spells, this second casting does not require you to prepare it in another spell slot. If you spontaneously cast spells, this second casting does not expend another available spell slot. An echoing spell uses up a spe

SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:When you are performing, allies within 20 feet who also have this feat can aid you with your Perform checks (including those made as part of bardic performance) as if they were aiding another as an immediate action. The allies make their aid another rolls before you make your check. No more than four allies can grant you a bonus with aid another. Allies aiding you do not need to use the same category of the Perform skill that you are using in order to aid you.

BONUS:VAR|FamiliarEP|1									SOURCEPAGE:p.149	BENEFIT:Select an evolution from the list of 1-point evolutions available to a summoner’s eidolon. Your familiar has this evolution. The familiar must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, no familiars can benefit from the mount evolution and only familiars with wings can take the wing buffet evolution. If you gain a new familiar, your old familiar loses all evolutions, and you can select a new 1-point evolution for the new familiar.

SOURCEPAGE:p.152	BENEFIT:You may implant a bomb in a willing or helpless creature (a mindless creature under your control, such as a zombie, counts as willing for this purpose). This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature’s square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb’s damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.	BENEFIT:If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb’s damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).	BENEFIT:Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a dispel magic spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC %1).|11 + classlevel("Alchemist")
