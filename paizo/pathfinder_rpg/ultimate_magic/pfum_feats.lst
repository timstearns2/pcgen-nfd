SOURCEPAGE:p.142	BENEFIT:Choose one of your revelations that has a number of uses per day. You gain 1 additional use per day of that revelation.
Accursed Critical				TYPE:Critical																									PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=9		PREFEAT:1,Critical Focus																			PRESPELL:1,Bestow Curse,Major Curse																		DESC:Your spells carry an embedded curse that manifests when they strike true.														SOURCEPAGE:p.142	BENEFIT:When you confirm a critical hit with a spell or spell-like ability, you may cast bestow curse or major curse on that target as an immediate action. This works even with ranged spells. You must have bestow curse or major curse prepared or otherwise available to cast, and using this ability casts the corresponding spell.
Accursed Hex				TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Hex ~ Witch																																																																	DESC:You can make a second attempt at failed hexes.																			SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:When you target a creature with a hex that cannot target the same creature more than once per day, and that creature succeeds at its saving throw against the hex’s effect, you can target the creature with the same hex a second time before the end of your next turn. If the second attempt fails, you can make no further attempts to target that creature with the same hex for 1 day.
Advanced Ranger Trap			TYPE:General				PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Trap ~ Ranger													PRECLASS:1,Ranger=5																																																	DESC:Your ranger traps are especially difficult to notice and avoid.

Add a +1 to the Difficulty Class on all saving throws against the effects of the trap you make with your trap class feature.
Antagonize					TYPE:General																																																																													DESC:Whether with biting remarks or hurtful words, you are adept at making creatures angry with you.											SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:You can make Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to make creatures respond to you with hostility. No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Wisdom modifier. The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Blighted Critical				TYPE:Critical																									PRECLASS:1,SPELLCASTER=5																																																DESC:With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.											SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a touch spell, ranged touch spell, or spell-like ability against an opponent, the victim gains a random minor spellblight.

Burning Spell				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																													DESC:You cause creatures to take extra damage when you affect them with a spell that has the acid or fire descriptor.					ADDSPELLLEVEL:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:The acid or fire effects of the affected spell adhere to the creature, causing more damage the next round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected spell, that creature takes damage equal to 2 × the spell’s actual level at the start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell’s descriptor. If a burning spell has both the fire and acid descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning spell effect. A burning spell uses up a slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.

SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:As a swift action, you can spend a use of your channel energy to grant yourself a +2 deflection bonus while using a shield. This bonus lasts 1 minute per cleric level or effective cleric level. While you benefit from this bonus, allies with shields also gain a +2 deflection bonus while they are adjacent to you.
Concussive Spell				TYPE:Metamagic																																																																													DESC:You cause creatures to be disoriented when you affect them with a spell that has the sonic descriptor.							ADDSPELLLEVEL:2	SOURCEPAGE:p.143	BENEFIT:With sonic damage comes a concussive wave of energy that rattles creatures affected by the spell. A concussive spell causes creatures that take damage from a spell that has the sonic descriptor to take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to the actual spell level of the spell. A concussive spell only affects spells with the sonic descriptor. A concussive spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level.
Create Reliquary Arms and Shields	TYPE:ItemCreation																															PREFEAT:1,Craft Magic Arms and Armor																	PRESPELL:1,Consecrate,Desecrate																		DESC:Your magical creations are infused with divine power.																		SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you may add one casting of consecrate or desecrate as part of the item crafting process. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine focus of your deity. If you cast consecrate or desecrate, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell’s area.
Create Sanguine Elixir			TYPE:ItemCreation																									PRECLASS:1,Sorcerer=3			PREFEAT:1,Brew Potion															PRESKILL:1,Craft (Alchemy)=12														PRESTAT:1,CHA=15								DESC:You can condense a fraction of your bloodline’s power into a powerful elixir.													SOURCEPAGE:p.148	BENEFIT:Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline powers. You transfer that power into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline power. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline power until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.
