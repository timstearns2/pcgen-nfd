Self-Resurrection	KEY:Self-Resurrection ~ Phoenix	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural.Defensive						DESC:A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds, unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate, at which time fully healed phoenix emerges from the remains as if brought back to life via resurrection.	SOURCEPAGE:p.227																BENEFIT:A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed phoenix emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via resurrection. The phoenix gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs, although most use greater restoration to remove this negative level as soon as possible. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A phoenix that dies within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A phoenix brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.
Shroud of Flame	KEY:Shroud of Flame ~ Phoenix		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural.Aura		DEFINE:ShroudofFireDC|0		DESC:A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action.																												SOURCEPAGE:p.227																BENEFIT:A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within reach (20 feet for most phoenixes) must make a DC %1 Reflex save each round to avoid taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit.|ShroudofFireDC

You heal damage at %1 points per round, as with fast healing, but you cannot die as long as your regeneration is still functioning (although you still fall unconscious when their hit points are below 0). Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, cause your regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack. During this round, you cannot heal any damage and can die normally. Attack forms that don't deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. Regeneration also does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. You can regrow lost portions of you body and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.|RegenerationRate

Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. A pixie can use this dust %1 times each day. The dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie’s chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits; it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow, Charm, Memory Loss or Sleep.|CHASCORE

If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage.								SOURCEPAGE:p.230	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(4d8+18 bludgeoning damage, AC 21, 20 hp)										BENEFIT:If you begin your turn with an opponent grappled in your mouth, you can attempt a new combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you swallow your prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than you. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while you do not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 of your total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor Class of your interior is normally 10 + 1/2 of your natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in your mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
