As long as they can hear the performance, affected creatures may not attack or flee until they have eliminated every such effect, though they are freed from this compulsion immediately if attacked. Creatures in the area must make this save each round the bard continues his performance. This ability is language-dependent and requires audible components. This performance replaces inspire heroics.

The act of drinking is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The monk can have a maximum number of drunken ki points equal to 1 plus one additional point for every two levels thereafter (5th, 7th, and so on). The monk can gain this temporary ki even before he gains a ki pool at 4th level. These drunken ki points last for 1 hour or until spent, whichever is shorter. As long as he has at least 1 drunken ki point, the monk can spend 1 ki point as a move action to move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces still mind.	TYPE:MonkStillMind

This ability replaces Stunning Fist.	TYPE:MonkStunningFist
Steal Ki			KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Steal Ki			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 5th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki from other creatures, though this ability is controversial in some circles of monks, who see it as nothing less than a form of vampirism. If the monk scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he can steal some of that creature's ki. This ability replenishes 1 spent ki point to the monk's ki pool, as long as the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool. He cannot exceed his ki pool's maximum. At 11th level, each time the monk successfully steals ki, he can make an immediate saving throw against one disease he is suffering from. There is no penalty for failing this saving throw.

Life Funnel			KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Life Funnel		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 7th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal a creature's life force to replenish his own. If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool and scores a confirmed critical hit against a living enemy or reduces a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, he heals a number of hit points equal to his monk level. As with steal ki, some monks believe that life funnel is an unsavory act, no better than what the undead do to the living. A monk with this ability cannot steal both ki and hit points at the same time. This ability replaces wholeness of body.	TYPE:MonkWholenessOfBody
Life from a Stone		KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Life from a Stone	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a hungry ghost monk can steal ki or life force from any creature, not just living creatures. If the monk has at least 1 ki point in his pool, he gains the benefit of life funnel and steal ki when he confirms a critical hit against any creature or reduces any creature to 0 or fewer hit points. This ability replaces diamond body.	TYPE:MonkDiamondBody
Sipping Demon		KEY:Hungry Ghost Monk ~  Sipping Demon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:A 13th level, a hungry ghost monk gains 1 temporary hit point each time he hits an enemy with a melee attack. The monk gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his Wisdom modifier when he scores a critical hit. The maximum number of temporary hit points the monk can have is equal to his monk level. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. The monk can only use this ability when he has at least 1 ki point in his ki pool. This ability is a proscribed manipulation of ki considered by many good monks to be a corruption. The ability replaces diamond soul.	TYPE:MonkDiamondSoul

# Ki Mystic
Ki Mystic			KEY:Ki Mystic ~  Ki Mystic		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, a ki mystic gains a pool of ki points equal to his Wisdom modifier.

Mystic Insight		KEY:Ki Mystic ~  Mystic Insight	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, a ki mystic becomes apt at giving just the right word of advice in just the nick of time. As an immediate action, the monk can spend 2 ki points to grant an ally within 30 feet the ability to reroll a single attack roll or saving throw. The ally must be able to hear the monk to gain the reroll benefit. This ability replaces purity of body.	TYPE:MonkPurityOfBody
Mystic Visions		KEY:Ki Mystic ~  Mystic Visions	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a ki mystic may receive mystic visions when he rests. These visions can come as a dream, an epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in the monk's mind. The effect is similar to a divination spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The divination has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 ki points that are removed from the next day's total. This ability replaces diamond body.	TYPE:MonkDiamondBody
Mystic Prescience		KEY:Ki Mystic ~  Mystic Prescience	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 13th level, a ki mystic gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and CMD. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +4. This ability replaces diamond soul.	TYPE:MonkDiamondSoul
Mystic Persistence	KEY:Ki Mystic ~  Mystic Persistence	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 19th level, a ki mystic can create an aura once per day as a swift action at the cost of at least 2 points of ki. The aura emanates out to a 20-foot radius. The monk and all allies within the aura can roll two dice when making an attack roll or a saving throw and take the better result. The aura lasts for 1 round, plus an additional round for every 2 ki points spent when the monk created the aura. The monk can dismiss the aura at any time as a free action, but the ki points for the full duration of the aura are lost. This ability replaces empty body.	TYPE:MonkEmptyBody

# Monk of the Empty Hand
Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Monk of the Empty Hand ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:Monks of the empty hand are proficient with the shuriken only.

Flurry of Blows			KEY:Monk of the Empty Hand ~ Flurry of Blows			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:Starting at 1st level, a monk of the empty hand can make a f lurry of blows using any combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with an improvised weapon.

Ki Weapons				KEY:Monk of the Empty Hand ~ Ki Weapons				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, a monk of the empty hand may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to deal damage equal to his unarmed strike damage with an improvised weapon for 1 round. At 11th level, the monk may spend ki to grant an enhancement bonus or magical weapon abilities to an improvised weapon for 1 round, at the rate of 1 point of ki per +1 bonus or its equivalent. The monk may not spend more than 3 points of ki at one time for this purpose. For example, a monk can spend 2 points of ki to give his improvised weapon a +1 enhancement bonus and the ki focus quality, or just the f laming burst quality. At 15th level, the limit increases to 5 ki per round. The monk may use this ability to add magical weapon qualities to improvised weapons that could not normally have such a quality, such as adding the disruption quality to a slashing weapon, or the vorpal quality to a bludgeoning weapon. This ability replaces purity of body and diamond body.	TYPE:MonkPurityOfBody.MonkDiamondBody

The monk can use these actions to do the following: take a melee attack action, use a skill, use an extraordinary ability, or take a move action. The monk cannot use these actions to cast spells or use spell-like abilities, and cannot combine them to take full-attack actions. Any move actions the monk makes this turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability replaces abundant step.	TYPE:MonkAbundantStep
Immortality			KEY:Monk of the Four Winds ~ Immortality			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 20th level, a monk of the four winds no longer ages.

As a full-round action, the monk can spend 2 ki points to heal a number of hit points equal to the monk's level. He needs at least one hand free to use this ability, and cannot heal himself.

Ki Sacrifice		KEY:Monk of the Healing Hand ~ Ki Sacrifice		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a monk of the healing hand can use his entire ki pool to bring a person back to life.

When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first.

# Paladin Archetype Powers
# Divine Defender
Shared Defense	KEY:Divine Defender ~ Shared Defense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25%% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy fortification armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.	TYPE:PaladinMercy
Divine Bond		KEY:Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7): champion*, ghost touch, heavy fortification, invulnerability, light fortification, moderate fortification, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 of the Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.	TYPE:PaladinDivineBond

# Hospitaler
Smite Evil			KEY:Hospitaler ~ Smite Evil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:This functions as the paladin ability, but the hospitaler can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels thereafter).		TYPE:PaladinSmiteEvil
Channel Positive Energy	KEY:Hospitaler ~ Channel Positive Energy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a hospitaler reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric equal to her paladin level -3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability does not expend uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins. This replaces the standard paladin's channel positive energy ability.	TYPE:PaladinChannelPositiveEnergy
Aura of Healing		KEY:Hospitaler ~ Aura of Healing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use of her channel positive energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal to her paladin level. Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any aff lictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the aff liction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times. This ability replaces aura of justice.	TYPE:PaladinAuraOfJustice

# Sacred Servant
Smite Evil			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Smite Evil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:This functions as the paladin ability, but the sacred servant can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels thereafter). This replaces smite evil.	TYPE:PaladinSmiteEvil
Spells			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 4th level, when a sacred servant gains the ability to cast spells, she also chooses one domain associated with her deity. Her effective cleric level for this domain is equal to her paladin level -3. In addition, she also gains one domain spell slot for each level of paladin spells she can cast. Every day she must prepare the domain spell from her chosen domain in that spell slot.	
Divine Bond			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Divine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/ day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred servant takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
Call Celestial Ally	KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Call Celestial Ally	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast lesser planar ally once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves to planar ally and at 16th level, this improves to greater planar ally. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level. This ability replaces aura of resolve.	TYPE:PaladinAuraOfResolve

# Shining Knight
Skilled Rider	KEY:Shining Knight ~ Skilled Rider		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary.Supernatural		DESC:At 3rd level, a shining knight does not take any penalty to her Ride skill due to her armor check penalty. In addition, any mount she is riding gains the benefit of her divine grace class feature, adding her Charisma bonus (if any) to its saving throws. This ability replaces divine health.	TYPE:PaladinDivineHealth
Divine Bond		KEY:Shining Knight ~ Divine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Upon reaching 5th level, a shining knight must form a bond with a mount. This ability otherwise functions as the paladin ability.	TYPE:PaladinBondedWeapon
Knight's Charge	KEY:Shining Knight ~ Knight's Charge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, whenever a mounted shining knight charges a foe, her movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, for either her or her mount. In addition, if her target is also the target of her smite evil ability and the charge attack hits, the target must make a Will save or be panicked for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shining knight's level. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shining knight's level + the shining knight's Charisma modifier. This ability replaces aura of justice.	TYPE:PaladinAuraofJustice

# Undead Scourge
Smite Evil			KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Smite Evil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:This functions as the paladin ability of the same name, but the undead scourge does not deal 2 points of damage per level on the first successful attack against evil dragons and evil outsiders. She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made against evil undead creatures.	TYPE:PaladinSmiteEvil
Aura of Life		KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Aura of Life		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, an undead scourge emits a 10-foot aura of life around her that weakens undead creatures. Undead in this aura take a -4 penalty on Will saves made to resist positive energy. In addition, undead in this aura do not regain hit points from channeled negative energy. This ability replaces aura of resolve.	TYPE:PaladinAuraOfResolve
Undead Annihilation	KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Undead Annihilation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead creature. If this attack hits, the undead creature must make a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the undead scourge's level + the undead scourge's Charisma modifier. Undead with twice as many Hit Dice as the undead scourge are unaffected by this ability. If the attack misses, the smite evil is wasted without effect. This ability replaces aura of justice.	TYPE:PaladinAuraOfJustice

# Warrior of the Holy Light
Power of Faith	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items. At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute. At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day. At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as daylight for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated. At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25%% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as light fortification). At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%%.	TYPE:PaladinSpells
Shining Light	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Shining Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can unleash a 30-foot burst of pure, white light as a standard action. Evil creatures within this burst take 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Ref lex save halves this damage and negates the blindness. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round. A warrior of the holy light can use this ability once per day at 14th level plus one additional time per day at 17th and 20th levels. This ability replaces aura of faith.	TYPE:PaladinAuraOfFaith

Animal Companion		KEY:Beast Master ~ Animal Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices-he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can.

Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion).

# Air School
Air Supremacy	KEY:Air School ~ Air Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Fly skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can cast feather fall on yourself at will. At 5th level, you can cast levitate on yourself at will. At 10th level, you can cast fly on yourself at will. At 20th level, whenever you make a Fly skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.
Lightning Flash	KEY:Air School ~ Lightning Flash	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can unleash a flash of electricity. This flash deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and dazzles them for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save negates the dazzled effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier.

Cyclone		KEY:Air School ~ Cyclone		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, you can create a vortex of turbulent wind around yourself as a standard action. This vortex has a radius of up to 10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per wizard level you possess. Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses. Any flying creature moving through the vortex must make a Fly skill check or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the creature cannot make a Fly check to reduce or negate this damage). Creatures on the ground cannot pass through the vortex without first making a Strength check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your caster level. The vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15 Perception skill check. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

# Earth School
Earth Supremacy	KEY:Earth School ~ Earth Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your CMD to resist bull rush, pull, push, reposition, trip, and overrun attempts as long as you are touching the ground. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you gain a +1 insight bonus on melee attack and damage rolls whenever both you and your foe are touching the ground. At 20th level, earth and stone do not block the line of effect of your spells, although they do still block your line of sight.
Acid Cloud		KEY:Earth School ~ Acid Cloud		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can create a 5-foot-radius cloud of acid vapor within 30 feet that lasts for 1 round. This cloud deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures in the cloud and sickens them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the sickened effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that begin their turn inside the cloud can move out that turn without penalty, but those that enter the cloud are affected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Earth Glide		KEY:Earth School ~ Earth Glide	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, you gain the ability to move through earth, dirt, and stone for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. You cannot move through worked earth or stone; only natural substances can be traversed. If your total duration expires before you exit the earth, you are flung back to the point where you entered the stone, take 4d6 points of damage, and are stunned for 1 round. Your burrowing does not leave a hole, nor does it give any sign of your presence (although you can be detected by creatures with tremorsense). These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

# Fire School
Fire Supremacy	KEY:Fire School ~ Fire Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of flame at least as large as a campfire, you can draw the fire around you for 1 round as a swift action. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or unarmed strike takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with reach avoid this damage.
Fire Jet		KEY:Fire School ~ Fire Jet		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of fire. Anyone in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their saving throw catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage on the following round. Creatures that catch fire can avoid this damage by taking a full-round action to extinguish the flames by making a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground gives a +2 circumstance bonus on the save. Dousing the creature with water automatically extinguishes the flame. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Dancing Flame	KEY:Fire School ~ Dancing Flame	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, as a standard action, you can sculpt fire to suit your desires. With one use of this ability you can move any nonmagical fire up to 30 feet. Alternatively you can use this ability to alter any fire spell that you cast with a duration of instantaneous by removing any number of squares from its area of affect. If the fire spell has a duration, you can use this ability to reposition the spell, within its original range (treat this as if you had just cast the spell, even though the duration is unchanged). You cannot use this ability on a fire spell that you did not cast. If you move a nonmagical flame, it must have a new source of fuel. If it does not, it is extinguished in one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

# Water School
Water Supremacy	KEY:Water School ~ Water Supremacy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Swim skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid drowning. At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. At 20th level, whenever you make a Swim skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.
Cold Blast		KEY:Water School ~ Cold Blast		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of freezing cold. This blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and staggers them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the staggered effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Wave			KEY:Water School ~ Wave			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, you can create a wave of water that starts at your location and moves 30 feet per round away from you in a direction of your choosing. Creatures struck by the wave might be knocked down and pushed away. Make a caster level check against the CMD of each creature struck. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone. If your check exceeds the CMD of the creature by 5 or more, it is carried with the wave during the wave's movement this round. You receive a +5 bonus on this check if the creature shares its space with the wave at the start of your turn (when the wave moves). Creatures carried in this way can move out of the wave on their turn if they succeed on a Strength check (DC = 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier), but they cannot breathe while sharing space with the wave. The wave is up to 20 feet high and up to 5 feet long for each wizard level you possess. Nonmagical fires hit by the wave are automatically extinguished. Magical fire effects are unaffected. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

# Admixture School
Versatile Evocation	KEY:Wizard Admixture School ~ Versatile Evocation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:When you cast an evocation spell that does acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you may change the damage dealt to one of the other four energy types. This changes the descriptor of the spell to match the new energy type. Any non-damaging effects remain unchanged unless the new energy type invalidates them (an ice storm that deals fire damage might still provide a penalty on Perception checks due to smoke, but it would not create difficult terrain). Such effects are subject to GM discretion. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Elemental Manipulation	KEY:Wizard Admixture School ~ Elemental Manipulation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura that transforms magical energy. Choose an energy type from acid, cold, electricity, and fire, and a second type to transform it into. Any magical source of energy of this type with a caster level equal to or less than your wizard level is altered to the chosen energy type. This includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater than your caster level. For example, you could transform a white dragon's frigid breath weapon (a supernatural ability), but not a fire elemental's fiery touch (an extraordinary ability). If an effect lies only partially within your aura, only the portions within the aura are transformed. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.

# Banishment School
Unstable Bonds		KEY:Wizard Banishment School ~ Unstable Bonds		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 1st level, your touch can disrupt the bonds that hold a summoned or called creature on this plane. As a melee touch attack, you can cause a summoned or called creature to become shaken and staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Aura of Banishment	KEY:Wizard Banishment School ~ Aura of Banishment	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of banishment for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Any summoned or called creature in the area must make a Will save each round. Once the creature fails a Will saving throw, it is staggered as long as it remains inside the aura. If it fails a second Will saving throw, it is immediately sent back to its home plane and the spell that summoned it immediately ends. If that spell summoned more than one creature, only the creature that failed its saving throws is affected. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

# Controller School
Force of Will		KEY:Wizard Controller School ~ Force of Will		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you have charmed or dominated as though you shared a common language. At 11th level, affected creatures can communicate back to you via the telepathic link as well. At 20th level, any creature that succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment spell you have just cast is still affected for 1 round if the spell has a duration greater than 1 round.
Irresistible Demand	KEY:Wizard Controller School ~ Irresistible Demand	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike			DESC:At 8th level, you can force others to do your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature as though using the dominate monster spell, except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control over a dominated creature.

# Counterspell School
Disruption			KEY:Wizard Counterspell School ~ Disruption		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 1st level, you gain the ability to disrupt spellcasting with a touch. As a melee touch attack, you can place a disruptive field around the target. While the field is in place, the target must make a concentration check to cast any spell or to use a spell-like ability in addition to any other required concentration checks. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the spell's level. If the check is failed, the target's spell is wasted. This field lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Counterspell Mastery	KEY:Wizard Counterspell School ~ Counterspell Mastery	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 6th level, you gain Improved Counterspell as a bonus feat. You may attempt to counterspell an opponent's spell once per day as an immediate action (instead of a readied action). You must use a spell at least one level higher than the spell being countered to use this ability. You can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th.

# Creation School
Create Gear		KEY:Wizard Creation School ~ Create Gear		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:At 1st level, you can create any object that weighs no more than 1 pound per wizard level you possess. Creating an object in this way is a standard action. The item remains for 1 minute before fading away, although it disappears after one round if it leaves your possession. Creating an item to an exact specification might require a Craft skill check, subject to GM discretion. The object must be made of simple materials, such as wood, stone, glass, or metal, and cannot contain any moving parts. You could use this ability to create a dagger, but not a vial of alchemist's fire. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
Creator's Will	KEY:Wizard Creation School ~ Creator's Will	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike			DESC:At 8th level, you can cast minor creation as a spell-like ability. You can have no more than one minor creation active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the previous casting immediately ends. At 12th level, this ability improves to major creation. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

# Enhancement School
