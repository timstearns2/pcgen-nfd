# Summoner
# Ability Name	Unique Key				Category of Ability		Type										Visible		Required Ability							Required Stat	Define				Description																																Multiple?	Choose											Virtual Feat		Bonus to Ability Pool				Modify VAR							Source Page		Aspects								Description of the Benefits
Cantrips			KEY:Cantrips ~ Summoner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																DESC:You have learned a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.
Summon Monster		KEY:Summon Monster ~ Summoner	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike					DEFINE:SMLevel|0	DEFINE:SMTimes|0	DEFINE:SMDuration|0	DESC:Summon Monster %1 (Sp) ~ (%2 per day) cast as a standard action and the creatures remain for %3 minutes (instead of %3 rounds).|SMLevel|SMTimes|SMDuration

Eidolon								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary				DEFINE:EidolonLevel|0							DESC:A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner, an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by protection from evil and similar effects that prevent contact with summoned creatures. A summoner can summon his eidolon once per day in a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon hit points are unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns with half its normal hit points. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane due to damage, it cannot be summoned again until the following day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means of dispel magic, but spells such as dismissal and banishment work normally.															FOLLOWERS:Eidolon|1	COMPANIONLIST:Eidolon|RACETYPE=Eidolon

Life Link								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:A close bond is formed with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.
Bond Senses								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:As a standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. There is no range to this effect, but the eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.
Shield Ally								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary														DESC:Whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Maker's Call							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:As a standard action, a summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as dimension door, using the summoner's caster level. When used, the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 6th.
Transposition							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Use maker's call ability to swap locations with eidolon. If it is larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.
Aspect								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural				DEFINE:MasterLevel|0							DESC:Divert up to 2 points from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as well. He cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions he receives from these points any time he can change the eidolon's evolutions.																																																																																																																																				BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Eidolon Evolution|2
Greater Shield Ally						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Whenever an ally is within an eidolon's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.
Life Bond								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Summoner's life becomes linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, the summoner cannot be killed. Damage in excess of that which would kill the summoner is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with the summoner, killing him.  Effects that cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful polymorph, flesh to stone, or imprisonment, or other spells that do not cause actual damage.
Merge Forms								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:As a full-round action, a summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).  The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any material components used for these spells are taken from the summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The summoner can direct all of the eidolon's actions while merged, can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice. The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.
Greater Aspect							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Summoner can divert more of his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof) diverted to the summoner.																																																																																																																																																																									BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Eidolon Evolution|4
Twin Eidolon							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural														DESC:Summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.
Gate				KEY:Gate ~ Summoner		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike															DESC:Summoner may cast Summon Monster 9 or Gate with his spell-like abilty.
