The effect is similar to a divination spell with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The divination has no casting time; it is just part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night.

While a monk of the lotus realizes that combat cannot always be avoided-and is more than capable in a fight-he understands that all creatures are connected, and to harm another is to harm the self. Instead, he strives to find peaceful resolutions to conf licts, and in doing so, hopes to achieve inner peace. A monk of the lotus has the following class features.

Touch of Surrender	KEY:Monk of the Lotus ~ Touch of Surrender	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 12th level, a monk of the lotus makes a foe into a friend with a single show of mercy. As an immediate action, when one of his melee attacks would reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the monk can spend 6 ki points to make the target of that attack surrender. When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first. The monk can only have one creature charmed with touch of surrender at a time. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability replaces abundant step.

On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage, but the target is charmed as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creature is charmed for 1 day per level. If the monk or his allies attack the charmed creature, or if the monk asks or commands the charmed creature to take hostile actions, the effect ends. This is a mind-affecting charm effect. This ability replaces quivering palm.
Learned Master		KEY:Monk of the Lotus ~ Learned Master		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 17th level, a monk of the lotus gains all Knowledge skills and the Linguistics skill as class skills. The monk uses Wisdom instead of Intelligence as the key ability for these skills. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and the moon.
