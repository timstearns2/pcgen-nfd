The ritual uses all of the ki in the monk's ki pool; the monk must have at least 6 points of ki in his ki pool to use this ability. At 15th level, the monk may sacrifice his ki to cast resurrection. The monk must have at least 8 points of ki in his ki pool to use this ability. These rituals do not require material components.

When the monk does this, he is truly and utterly destroyed. A monk destroyed in this way can never come back to life, not even by way of a wish or miracle spell or by the power of a deity. Furthermore, the monk's name can never be spoken or written down again. All written mentions of his name become nothing more than a blank space. This ability replaces perfect self.

Monk of the Lotus	SOURCEPAGE:p.114	DESC:Monks are warriors who hone their bodies into deadly weapons, but some monks eschew violence in favor of a more peaceful philosophy. While a monk of the lotus realizes that combat cannot always be avoidedand is more than capable in a fighthe understands that all creatures are connected, and to harm another is to harm the self. Instead, he strives to find peaceful resolutions to conf licts, and in doing so, hopes to achieve inner peace. A monk of the lotus has the following class features.

When the target surrenders, it is reduced to 0 hit points, becomes disabled, and is charmed, as if the monk had cast charm monster with a caster level equal to the monk's level. The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first.

The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. The creature is charmed for 1 day per level.

At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1.

At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy fortification armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.
Divine Bond		KEY:Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7): champion*, ghost touch, heavy fortification, invulnerability, light fortification, moderate fortification, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 154 of the Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a 1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Aura of Healing		KEY:Hospitaler ~ Aura of Healing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Su): At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use of her channel positive energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal to her paladin level. Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any aff lictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the aff liction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Sacred Servant	SOURCEPAGE:p.117	DESC:Paladins as a general rule, venerate the gods of good and purity, but some take this a step further, dedicating themselves to a specific deity and furthering the cause of the faith.

Every day she must prepare the domain spell from her chosen domain in that spell slot.
Divine Bond			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Divine Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC:(Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/ day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first.

Call Celestial Ally	KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Call Celestial Ally	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Sp): At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant.

Skilled Rider	KEY:Shining Knight ~ Skilled Rider	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex and Su): At 3rd level, a shining knight does not take any penalty to her Ride skill due to her armor check penalty.

Knight's Charge	KEY:Shining Knight ~ Knight's Charge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Su): At 11th level, whenever a mounted shining knight charges a foe, her movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, for either her or her mount.

The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shining knight's level + the shining knight's Charisma modifier. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Undead Scourge	SOURCEPAGE:p.117	DESC:Undead are an abomination in the eyes of the just and righteous. It is no surprise then that there are some paladins that dedicate themselves to wiping these unholy terrors from the world. The following are the class features of the undead scourge.

Undead Annihilation	KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Undead Annihilation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Su): At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead creature. If this attack hits, the undead creature must make a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the undead scourge's level + the undead scourge's Charisma modifier. Undead with twice as many Hit Dice as the undead scourge are unaffected by this ability. If the attack misses, the smite evil is wasted without effect. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Warrior of the Holy Light	SOURCEPAGE:p.118	DESC:Some paladins use their gifts to focus on the holy light that shines within their souls. With the gifts of purity and redemption, these paladins spend much of their lives helping others find the true path. Unleashing this power takes patience and comes at a steep price.

# Warrior of the Holy Light
Power of Faith	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Su): At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items. At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute. At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day. At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as daylight for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated. At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as light fortification). At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2.

The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the warrior of the holy light's level + the warrior of the holy light's Charisma modifier. Good creatures within this burst are healed 1d6 points of damage per two paladin levels and receive a +2 sacred bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 round.

This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level  3.

Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choiceshe may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can. The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.
Improved Empathic Link	KEY:Beast Master ~ Improved Empathic Link	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Su): The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.
Strong Bond			KEY:Beast Master ~ Strong Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The ranger's effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit. This ability replaces camouf lage.

Guide	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Many rangers are loners, but some choose to use their familiarity with the land to guide others safely through the wilderness. The guide forgoes a favored enemy to focus on the task or foe at hand, and can pass his knowledge and luck on to his charges. A guide has the following class features.
# Guide	
Ranger's Focus		KEY:Guide ~ Ranger's Focus	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): At 1st level, once per day, the guide can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That creature remains the ranger's focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the ranger designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of his focus. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 4th level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the ranger can use this ability one additional time per day. This ability replaces favored enemy.
Terrain Bond		KEY:Guide ~ Terrain Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): At 4th level, the guide forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain.

Also, as long as they travel with him, the ranger's allies leave no trail and can't be tracked. The ranger can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even specif ic members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires. This ability replaces hunter's bond.
Ranger's Luck		KEY:Guide ~ Ranger's Luck	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): Upon reaching 9th level, once per day the guide can either reroll one of his attack rolls or force an enemy who just hit him with an attack to reroll the attack roll. The ranger must take the result of the second roll even if it is worse. A ranger can use this ability once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at 14th and 19th levels. This ability replaces evasion.
Inspired Moment		KEY:Guide ~ Inspired Moment	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC:(Ex): At 11th level, the guide can have an inspired moment once per day as a free action. The ranger gains the following benefits until the end of his next turn. His speed increases by 10 feet. He can take an extra move or swift action on his turn.

This bonus or penalty is also applied on any roll to confirm critical hits. This ability replaces improved evasion.

Horse Lord	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Rangers of the plains use horses or other riding beasts to hunt their lands, forging a near-mystical relationship with their mounts. Horse lords are unparalleled mounted combatants, the envy of even the most dedicated cavalier. Though called horse lords as a generic term, these rangers are not restricted to horses for their animal companions any creature the ranger can ride is included in these abilities. A horse lord has the following class features.
# Horse Lord

A Medium ranger can select a camel or a horse. A small ranger can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or dog if he is at least 7th level. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level  3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks with his animal companion mount. This ability replaces hunter's bond.
Strong Bond		KEY:Horse Lord ~ Strong Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC:(Ex): At 12th level, the horse lord strengthens his bond with his mount. The ranger's effective druid level for his mount is now equal to his ranger level. This ability replaces camouf lage.

While these temporary hit points last, when his mount is within 30 feet of the him, he can choose to share the damage taken by his mount as if using shield other. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.

Infiltrator	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Some rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes' strengths against them. Infiltrators are willing to walk a mile in an enemy's shoes so as to learn eveything there is to know about their foes in order to more effectively hunt and kill them.
# Infiltrator
Adaptation			KEY:Infiltrator ~ Adaptation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): At 3rd level, an infiltrator learns how to copy the unusual abilities of his prey. He chooses one type of creature he has selected as a favored enemy, such as aberrations. The ranger selects one ability or feat from the adaptation list for that type (see below). A ranger can use adaptations for 10 minutes per day per ranger level he possesses. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. If the adaptation requires the ranger to make a more specif ic choice (such as what skill to use with Skill Focus), this choice is permanent and cannot be changed. At 8th, 13th, and 15th-level, the ranger chooses another one of his favored enemy types and selects one adaptation from that type's list, as well as an additional adaptation from any one list of a creature type he's selected (including the one just chosen, if so desired). The infiltrator can only use one adaptation at a time. This class ability replaces favored terrain.

Shapeshifter	SOURCEPAGE:p.126	DESC:Most rangers venture into the wilderness, but there are some who let the wilderness seep into them. Whether by curse, disease, ancient rite, a slight lycanthropic inf luence in the blood, or the corrupting inf luence of chaos, these rangers embrace the wild to transform themselves into something untamed and feral. Shapeshifters are often held in awe, but are even more often feared. A shapeshifter has the following class features.

Hunter's Tricks		KEY:Skirmisher ~ Hunter's Tricks	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC:: At 5th level, a skirmisher ranger learns the use of hunter's tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the ranger or a nearby ally.

# Spirit Ranger
Spirit Bond			KEY:Spirit Ranger ~ Spirit Bond	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): At 4th level, instead of forming a bond with his hunting companions or an animal companion, the spirit ranger forms a bond with the spirits of nature themselves.

In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.

Blend In			KEY:Urban Ranger ~ Blend In			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC: (Ex): An urban ranger of 12th level or higher can use his Stealth bonus in place of a Disguise skill check in any of his favored communities.

This changes the descriptor of the spell to match the new energy type.

This includes supernatural effects from creatures with Hit Dice no greater than your caster level. For example, you could transform a white dragon's frigid breath weapon (a supernatural ability), but not a fire elemental's fiery touch (an extraordinary ability).
