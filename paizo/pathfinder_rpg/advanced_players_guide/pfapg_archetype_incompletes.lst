The target does not get a saving throw against this effect. This charm lasts until its duration expires, until the monk dismisses it or uses it on another creature, or until the target is again reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, whichever happens first.

# Paladin:
Divine Defender			COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.116	DESC:Some paladins see themselves as the last line of defense between the teeming hordes of evil and the innocent folk trying to make a living in a harsh, unforgiving world. These defenders spend their lives protecting others and taking on foes that the common man should not even know exist. To aid them in their holy mission, they have special powers to protect themselves and those around them. The divine defender has the following class features.	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Divine Defender ~ Shared Defense|PRECLASS:1,Paladin=3	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond|PRECLASS:1,Paladin=5

# Divine Defender
Shared Defense	KEY:Divine Defender ~ Shared Defense	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 3rd level, a divine defender can spend one use of her lay on hands ability as a standard action to grant all adjacent allies (including paladins) a bonus. At 3rd level, adjacent allies receive a +1 sacred bonus to their AC and CMD and on their saving throws. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the divine defender's Charisma modifier. At 9th level and 15th level, this bonus increases by +1. At 6th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 10 feet, and allies that are at fewer than 0 hit points within this area are automatically stabilized. At 12th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 15 feet, and allies within this area are immune to bleed damage. At 18th level, these bonuses are granted to all allies within 20 feet, and allies within this area gain a 25% chance to negate any sneak attack or critical hit scored against them. This ability does not stack with the chance provided from the light, medium, or heavy fortification armor special abilities. These bonuses are cumulative with each other. Allies only benefit from these bonuses while in the listed area. This ability replaces mercy.
Divine Bond		KEY:Divine Defender ~ Divine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a divine defender can form a bond with her armor. As a standard action, a divine defender can enhance her armor by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the armor, stacking with existing armor bonuses to a maximum of +3, or they can be used to add any of the following armor properties (asterisks note new armor properties found in Chapter 7): champion*, ghost touch, heavy fortification, invulnerability, light fortification, moderate fortification, spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19). Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 of the Core Rulebook). In addition, the bonuses can be consumed at the listed amount to add any of the following armor properties: energy resistance for +3 bonus, improved energy resistance for +5 bonus, or righteous* for +4 bonus. These bonuses are added to any properties the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the divine defender, but it resumes giving bonuses if the divine defender dons the armor again. A divine defender can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a suit of armor with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the divine defender loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the divine defender takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Smite Evil			KEY:Hospitaler ~ Smite Evil			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:This functions as the paladin ability, but the hospitaler can smite evil one additional time per day at 7th level, and every six levels thereafter (instead of 4th level and every three levels thereafter).
Channel Positive Energy	KEY:Hospitaler ~ Channel Positive Energy	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:When a hospitaler reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric equal to her paladin level -3. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. Using this ability does not expend uses of lay on hands, as it does with other paladins. This replaces the standard paladin's channel positive energy ability.
Aura of Healing		KEY:Hospitaler ~ Aura of Healing		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, a hospitaler can expend one use of her channel positive energy ability to emit a 30-foot aura of healing for a number of rounds equal to her paladin level. Allies in this aura (including the hospitaler) automatically stabilize if below 0 hit points and are immune to bleed damage. In addition, allies (including the paladin) that spend at least 1 full round inside the aura are healed an amount of damage equal to their total number of Hit Dice and may make a saving throw against any aff lictions they are suffering from, such as a curse, disease, or poison. This saving throw only counts toward curing the aff liction and does not impose any penalty on a failed save. Allies can only be healed once by a use of this ability and they can only attempt additional saving throws once per day, even if they are exposed to this aura multiple times. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Sacred Servant			COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.117	DESC:Paladins as a general rule, venerate the gods of good and purity, but some take this a step further, dedicating themselves to a specific deity and furthering the cause of the faith.

Spells			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Spells			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality			DESC:At 4th level, when a sacred servant gains the ability to cast spells, she also chooses one domain associated with her deity. Her effective cleric level for this domain is equal to her paladin level -3. In addition, she also gains one domain spell slot for each level of paladin spells she can cast. Every day she must prepare the domain spell from her chosen domain in that spell slot.
Divine Bond			KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Divine Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred servant forms a bond with her holy symbol. As a standard action, a sacred servant can bind a celestial spirit to her holy symbol for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the sacred servant's holy symbol to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants one bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the spirit grants one additional bonus. These bonuses can be spent in a number of ways to grant the paladin enhanced abilities to channel positive energy and to cast spells. Each bonus can be used to grant one of the following enhancements: +1 caster level to any paladin spell cast, +1 to the DC to halve the damage of channel positive energy when used to harm undead, +1d6 to channel positive energy, +1 use/ day of lay on hands. These enhancements stack and can be selected multiple times. The enhancements granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. If the sacred servant increases her number of uses of lay on hands per day in this way, that choice is set for the rest of the day, and once used, these additional uses are not restored (even if the spirit is called again that day). The celestial spirit imparts no enhancements if the holy symbol is held by anyone other than the sacred servant, but resumes giving enhancements if returned to the sacred servant. A sacred servant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level. If a holy symbol with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred servant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the sacred servant takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
Call Celestial Ally	KEY:Sacred Servant ~ Call Celestial Ally	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 8th level, a sacred servant can call upon her deity for aid, in the form of a powerful servant. This allows the sacred servant to cast lesser planar ally once per week as a spell-like ability without having to pay the material component cost or the servant (for reasonable tasks). At 12th level, this improves to planar ally and at 16th level, this improves to greater planar ally. The sacred servant's caster level for this effect is equal to her paladin level. This ability replaces aura of resolve.

Knight's Charge	KEY:Shining Knight ~ Knight's Charge	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, whenever a mounted shining knight charges a foe, her movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, for either her or her mount.

# Undead Scourge
Smite Evil			KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Smite Evil		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:This functions as the paladin ability of the same name, but the undead scourge does not deal 2 points of damage per level on the first successful attack against evil dragons and evil outsiders. She does deal 2 points of damage per level on all smite attacks made against evil undead creatures.
Aura of Life		KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Aura of Life		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 8th level, an undead scourge emits a 10-foot aura of life around her that weakens undead creatures. Undead in this aura take a -4 penalty on Will saves made to resist positive energy. In addition, undead in this aura do not regain hit points from channeled negative energy. This ability replaces aura of resolve.
Undead Annihilation	KEY:Undead Scourge ~ Undead Annihilation	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 11th level, an undead scourge can expend one use of her smite evil ability as a standard action and make a single melee attack against an undead creature.

ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith|PRECLASS:1,Paladin=4	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Shining Light|PRECLASS:1,Paladin=14

# Warrior of the Holy Light
Power of Faith	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Power of Faith	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 4th level, a warrior of the holy light learns to use the power of her faith to bolster her defenses and aid her allies. This class feature replaces the paladin's spells class feature. A warrior of the holy light does not gain any spells or spellcasting abilities, does not have a caster level, and cannot use spell trigger or spell completion magic items. At 4th level, the warrior of the holy light gains one additional use of her lay on hands ability per day. She gains one additional use of lay on hands per day for every four levels she attains beyond 4th. She can call upon the power of her faith as a standard action. This causes a nimbus of light to emanate from the warrior of the holy light in a 30-foot radius. All allies in this area (including the warrior of the holy light) receive a +1 morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear as long as they remain in the area of light. This power lasts for 1 minute. At 8th level, the nimbus of light heals the paladin and her allies, curing of them of 1d4 points of ability damage, as per the spell lesser restoration. A creature can only be healed in this way once per day. At 12th level, the nimbus of light is treated as daylight for the purposes of affecting creatures with sensitivity to light. In addition, the nimbus grants allies in the area resistance 10 to one type of energy, selected by the warrior of the holy light when this power is activated. At 16th level, the nimbus of light grants the warrior of the holy light and her allies protection from critical hits. There is a 25% chance that critical hits made against the warrior of the holy light and her allies in the area are instead treated as normal hits. This does not stack with other abilities that grant similar protection (such as light fortification). At 20th level, the nimbus of light increases in size out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, all of its bonuses increase. The morale bonus to AC and on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against fear increases to +2. The amount of ability damage healed increases to 2d4. The energy resistance increases to 20 against one energy type. Finally, protection against critical hits increases to 50%.
Shining Light	KEY:Warrior of the Holy Light ~ Shining Light	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:At 14th level, a warrior of the holy light can unleash a 30-foot burst of pure, white light as a standard action. Evil creatures within this burst take 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin levels and are blinded for 1 round. Evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead are blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A Ref lex save halves this damage and negates the blindness.

Beast Master	COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.124	DESC:Some rangers, particularly those in primitive lands or who were raised by animals, have unusually strong bonds with animals. Unique among rangers, they can bond with multiple animals of any kind, creating a menagerie of wild yet loyal creatures, like a strange family. A beast master has the following class features.

# Beast Master
Class Skills		KEY:Beast Master ~ Class Skills		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC:A beast master's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Perception (Wis), Ride (Dex), Stealth (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Wis). These replace the standard ranger class skills.			CSKILL:Acrobatics|Climb|TYPE.Craft|Escape Artist|Handle Animal|Heal|Intimidate|Knowledge (Nature)|Perception|Ride|Stealth|Survival|Swim
Animal Companion		KEY:Beast Master ~ Animal Companion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:A beast master forms a close bond with an animal companion. This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level - 3. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on wild empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding his animal companion. Unlike a normal ranger, a beast master's choice of animal companion is not limited to a subset of all possibile animal companion choices-he may choose freely among all animal companion choices, just as a druid can. The beast master may have more than one animal companion, but he must divide up his effective druid level between his companions to determine the abilities of each companion. For example, a beast master with an effective druid level of 4 can have one 4th-level companion, two 2nd-level companions, or one 1st-level and one 3rd-level companion. Each time a beast master's effective druid level increases, he must decide how to allocate the increase among his animal companions (including the option of adding a new 1st-level companion). Once an effective druid level is allocated to a particular companion, it cannot be redistributed while that companion is in the ranger's service (he must release a companion or wait until a companion dies to allocate its levels to another companion). The share spells animal companion ability does not give the ranger the ability to cast a single spell so that it affects all of his animal companions. This ability replaces hunter's bond.
Improved Empathic Link	KEY:Beast Master ~ Improved Empathic Link	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:The beast master gains an empathic link with all of his animal companions. This functions like an empathic link with a familiar, except the ranger can also see through a companion's eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as he likes (as long as the companion is within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. The ranger can only see through the eyes of one companion at a time, and is blinded while maintaining this connection. This replaces the 6th-level combat style feat.	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Ranger Bonus Feat|-1
Strong Bond			KEY:Beast Master ~ Strong Bond		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 12th level, the ranger strengthens his bond with his animal companions. The ranger's effective druid level for his animal companions is now equal to his ranger level; he may immediately allocate these additional levels to his companions as he sees fit. This ability replaces camouf lage.

Horse Lord		COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Rangers of the plains use horses or other riding beasts to hunt their lands, forging a near-mystical relationship with their mounts. Horse lords are unparalleled mounted combatants, the envy of even the most dedicated cavalier.

While these temporary hit points last, when his mount is within 30 feet of the him, he can choose to share the damage taken by his mount as if using shield other. This ability replaces hide in plain sight.

Infiltrator			COST:0	CATEGORY:Archetype	TYPE:Archetype	SOURCEPAGE:p.125	DESC:Some rangers study their favored enemies and learn their ways, applying this knowledge to their own abilities and using their foes' strengths against them. Infiltrators are willing to walk a mile in an enemy's shoes so as to learn eveything there is to know about their foes in order to more effectively hunt and kill them.

# Infiltrator
Adaptation			KEY:Infiltrator ~ Adaptation			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	DESC:At 3rd level, an infiltrator learns how to copy the unusual abilities of his prey.

# Skirmisher
Hunter's Tricks		KEY:Skirmisher ~ Hunter's Tricks		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality		DESC:At 5th level, a skirmisher ranger learns the use of hunter's tricks, which typically grant a boon or bonus to the ranger or a nearby ally. At 5th level, the ranger learns one trick, selected from the list below. At 7th level, and every two levels thereafter, he learns another trick.

In addition, he can call upon these spirits to cast any one ranger spell that he is capable of casting, without having to prepare the spell. At 8th level, and every four levels thereafter, he can cast an additional spell in this way. This replaces hunter's bond.
Wisdom of the Spirits	KEY:Spirit Ranger ~ Wisdom of the Spirits	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.SpellLike		DESC:At 12th level, the spirit ranger can use his augury spell-like ability even when he is not in one of his favored terrains.
