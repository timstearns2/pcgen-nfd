DESC:Aside from introducing the Council of Thieves Adventure Path, this guide is intended to aid players in the creation of characters native to Cheliax. The information presented herein is common knowledge, especially to characters who call Cheliax home. This guide is organized to help root characters in the area in and around Westcrownâ€”the focal point of this entire Adventure Path. While any character can take part in the Council of Thieves, those created and using this guide are likely to have more personal motivation as the events of the Adventure Path unfold.
