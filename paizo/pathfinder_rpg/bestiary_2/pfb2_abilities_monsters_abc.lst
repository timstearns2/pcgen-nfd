Black Cloud		KEY:Black Cloud ~ Achaierai	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:BlackCloudDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(2d6, DC %1 Fort or become confused)|BlackCloudDC	BENEFIT:An achaierai can exhale a cloud of choking, toxic smoke three times per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately take 2d6 points of damage as their flesh melts and rots away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC %1 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC %2 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes her saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect. Achaierais are immune to this ability|BlackCloudDC|BlackCloudDC


###Block: Aeon Abilities
# Ability Name	Unique Key							Category of Ability			Type						Define															Source Page			Aspects								Description of the Benefits
Envisaging			KEY:Envisaging ~ Aeon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality,Supernatural.Communicate												SOURCEPAGE:p.305										DESC:Aeons communicate wordlessly, almost incomprehensibly. Caring little for the wants and desires of other creatures, they have no need to engage in exchanges of dialogue. Instead, aeons mentally scan beings for their thoughts and intentions, and then retaliate with flashes of psychic projections that emit a single concept in response to whatever the other being was thinking. The flash is usually a combination of a visual and aural stimulation, which displays how the aeon perceives future events might work out. For instance, an aeon seeking to raze a city communicates this concept to non-aeons by sending them a vivid image of the city crumbling to ash. An aeon's envisaging functions as a non-verbal form of telepathy. Aeons cannot read the thoughts of any creature immune to mind-affecting effects.
Extension of All	KEY:Extension of All ~ Aeon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.306	BONUS:SKILL|TYPE=Knowledge|HD/2|TYPE=Racial		DESC:Through an aeon’s connection to the multiverse, it gains access to strange and abstruse knowledge that filters through all existence. Much of the knowledge is timeless, comprised of events long past, present, and potentially even those yet to come. Aeons gain a racial bonus equal to %1 on all Knowledge skill checks. This same connection also binds them to other aeons. As a result, they can communicate with each other freely, over great distances as if using telepathy. This ability also works across planes, albeit less effectively, allowing the communication of vague impressions or feelings, not specific details or sights. Due to the vast scope of the aeon race's multiplanar concerns,though, even the most dire reports of a single aeon rarely inspire dramatic or immediate action.
Void Form			KEY:Void Form ~ Aeon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DEFINE:VoidFormACBonus|0							SOURCEPAGE:p.306	BONUS:VAR|VoidFormACBonus|HD/4		DESC:Though aeons aren't incorporeal, their forms are only a semi-tangible manifestation of something greater. An aeon's void form grants it a +%1 deflection bonus.|VoidFormACBonus|HD/4
Soul Siphoning		KEY:Soul Siphoning ~ Aeon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:SoulSiphoningDC|0							SOURCEPAGE:p.9		BONUS:VAR|SoulSiphoningDC|10+HD/2+CON	DESC:As a swift action, an akhana can use its tail to siphon life essence from a grappled foe. At the start of the aeon's turn, the victim gains 1d4 negative levels (a DC %1 Fortitude save negates and grants immunity to this akhana's soul siphoning ability for 24 hours). When the number of negative levels equals the target's Hit Dice, the target's soul tears free from its mortal body and gets stored within the body of the akhana as a trap the soul spell. The victim's body remains preserved as if via a gentle repose spell for as long as the soul is held by the akhana. The akhana can keep the soul indefinitely, or can release it as a full-round action. Upon doing so, the released soul immediately returns to its body if the body is within 300 feet, at which point the body returns to life and any negative levels imparted to it by the akhana are removed. If the body is not within 300 feet (or if it has been destroyed), then the creature dies when its soul is released. A miracle, limited wish, or wish can force a displaced soul to return to its proper body. If an akhana is slain, any soul it contains is released automatically. An akhana can only hold one soul at a time.|SoulSiphoningDC
Aging Strike		KEY:Aging Strike ~ Aeon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:AgingStrikeDC|0								SOURCEPAGE:p.10		BONUS:VAR|AgingStrike|DC|10+HD/2+CON	DESC:If a bythos strikes a living target with two slam attacks in a single round, the bythos ages the creature, causing it to advance to the next age category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169) if it fails a %1 DC Fortitude save. The victim gains all of the penalties from this aging and none of the bonuses. A venerable victim targeted by this ability dies if it fails the save. This process is reversible with greater restoration, limited wish, miracle, or wish.|AgingStrikeDC
Confusion Gaze		KEY:Confusion Gaze ~ Aeon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:ConfusionGazeDC|0							SOURCEPAGE:p.10		BONUS:VAR|ConfusionGazeDC|10+HD/2+CHA	DESC:Confusion for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC %1 negates.|ConfusionGazeDC
Temporal Strike		KEY:Temporal Strike ~ Aeon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural			DEFINE:TemporalStrikeDC0							SOURCEPAGE:p.10		BONUS:VAR|TemporalStrikeDC|10+HD/2+CHA	DESC:As a standard action, a bythos can touch a creature or object to displace it from time. If the target fails a DC %1 Fortitude save, it disappears from the present moment and reappears in the same location 1d4 rounds later as if no time had passed. If an object occupies that space, the creature appears in the closest available space to its original location-this displacement does not cause the creature any additional harm.|TemporalStrikeDC
