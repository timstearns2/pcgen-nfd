Black Cloud		KEY:Black Cloud ~ Achaierai	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DEFINE:BlackCloudDC|10+(HD/2)+CHA	SOURCEPAGE:p.7	ASPECT:Ability Benefit|(2d6, DC %1 Fort or become confused)|BlackCloudDC	BENEFIT:An achaierai can exhale a cloud of choking, toxic smoke three times per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately take 2d6 points of damage as their flesh melts and rots away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC %1 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC %2 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes her saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect. Achaierais are immune to this ability|BlackCloudDC|BlackCloudDC


###Block: Aeon Abilities
# Ability Name	Unique Key							Category of Ability			Type						Define															Source Page			Aspects								Description of the Benefits
Envisaging			KEY:Envisaging ~ Aeon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality,Supernatural.Communicate												SOURCEPAGE:p.305										DESC:Aeons communicate wordlessly, almost incomprehensibly. Caring little for the wants and desires of other creatures, they have no need to engage in exchanges of dialogue. Instead, aeons mentally scan beings for their thoughts and intentions, and then retaliate with flashes of psychic projections that emit a single concept in response to whatever the other being was thinking. The flash is usually a combination of a visual and aural stimulation, which displays how the aeon perceives future events might work out. For instance, an aeon seeking to raze a city communicates this concept to non-aeons by sending them a vivid image of the city crumbling to ash. An aeon’s envisaging functions as a non-verbal form of telepathy. Aeons cannot read the thoughts of any creature immune to mind-affecting effects.
Extension of All	KEY:Extension of All ~ Aeon		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Extraordinary															SOURCEPAGE:p.305	BONUS:SKILL|TYPE=Knowledge|HD/2|TYPE=Racial		DESC:Through an aeon’s connection to the multiverse, it gains access to strange and abstruse knowledge that filters through all existence. Much of the knowledge is timeless, comprised of events long past, present, and potentially even those yet to come. Aeons gain a racial bonus equal to %1 on all Knowledge skill checks. This same connection also binds them to other aeons. As a result, they can communicate with each other freely, over great distances as if using telepathy. This ability also works across planes, albeit less effectively, allowing the communication of vague impressions or feelings, not specific details or sights. Due to the vast scope of the aeon race’s multiplanar concerns,though, even the most dire reports of a single aeon rarely inspire dramatic or immediate action.
Void Form			KEY:Void Form ~ Aeon			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DEFINE:VoidFormACBonus|0							SOURCEPAGE:p.306	BONUS:VAR|VoidFormACBonus|HD/4		DESC:Though aeons aren’t incorporeal, their forms are only a semi-tangible manifestation of something greater. An aeon’s void form grants it a +%1 deflection bonus.
