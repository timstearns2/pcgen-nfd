# Alchemist Discoveries
Breath Weapon Bomb*	KEY:Discovery ~ Breath Weapon Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6	DESC:Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, you can draw the components, drink them, mix them within your body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from your bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = %1) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|AlchemistBombDC
Explosive Missile		KEY:Discovery ~ Explosive Missile		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,4	DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate.
Immolation Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Immolation Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,3	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target’s body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb’s effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist’s turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb’s direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater.
Nauseating Flesh		KEY:Discovery ~ Nauseating Flesh		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	DESC:The alchemist’s body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.
Poison Conversion		KEY:Discovery ~ Poison Conversion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6	DESC:By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab.
Siege Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Siege Bomb			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Explosive Bomb		DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege weapon with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist’s next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist’s bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb’s damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage (or another energy type, if the alchemist is capable of modifying his bombs in that way) each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.
