GUN TANK			KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ GUN TANK			CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:Gunslingers usually don't use heavy armor, but there are a few who use and modify their armor to protect themselves from both traditional weapons and gunf ire. These gun tanks trundle into battle with barrels blazing, dealing out punishment with their firearms while knowing few can penetrate their hard protective shells.

Armor Proficiency		KEY:Armor Proficiency ~ GUN TANK			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:A gun tank is proficient with all armors and shields, including tower shields.																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Deeds				KEY:Deeds ~ GUN TANK					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:A gun tank swaps a pair of deeds for the following. The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Gun Tank's Resolve	KEY:Gun Tank's Resolve ~ GUN TANK			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. At 1st level, she has a 25%% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the chance increases to 50%%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%%. While a gun tank's resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.	SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Gun Tank's Resilience	KEY:Gun Tank's Resilience ~ GUN TANK		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This deed replaces the evasive deed.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Bullet Deflection		KEY:Bullet Deflection ~ GUN TANK			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor's bonus plus the armor's enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist's bomb class ability; Advanced Player's Guide 28). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack. This ability replaces nimble.																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Armor Training		KEY:Armor Training ~ GUN TANK				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the f ighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benef it of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.									SOURCEPAGE:p.50

MUSKET MASTER		KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ MUSKET MASTER		CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:Pistols and other one-handed firearms are often easy to conceal and faster to load than other firearms, and do suff icient damage for most situations. But some gunslingers want a little more firepower and range. These are the musket masters; the best of these gunslingers can reload a musket with dazzling speed, potentially putting even their pistol-wielding brethren to shame.

Steady Aim			KEY:Steady Aim ~ MUSKET MASTER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, as long as a musket master has at least 1 grit point, she can take a move-equivalent action to increase the accuracy of a two-handed firearm. When she does, she increases the range increment of the firearm she is firing by 10 feet. This stacks with other abilities that increase her range increment. This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.50
Fast Musket			KEY:Fast Musket ~ MUSKET MASTER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 3rd level, as long as the musket master has 1 grit point, she can reload any two-handed firearm as if it were a one-handed firearm. This deed replaces the utility shot deed.																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Rapid Reloader		KEY:Rapid Reloader ~ MUSKET MASTER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:At 1st level, a musket master gains Rapid Reload (muskets) as a bonus feat.

MYSTERIOUS STRANGER	KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ MYSTERIOUS STRANGER	CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:Gunslingers use a potent mixture of common sense and manual dexterity in order to control the fickle power of their weapons. But a few rare gunslingers seem to accomplish their chosen tasks purely through willpower and an unwillingness to ever give up. These mysterious strangers use their force of personality to keep going when the chips are down, often moving on from a region as soon as they accomplish their goals-hence the name.

Grit				KEY:Grit ~ MYSTERIOUS STRANGER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:A mysterious stranger is a force to be reckoned with.

Clipping Shot		KEY:Clipping Shot ~ MYSTERIOUS STRANGER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 11th level, when the mysterious stranger misses with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point to deal half the damage that attack would have dealt if it were a hit (roll damage normally). She can decide to use this deed and spend the grit point after making the attack. This deed has no effect if the attack used the dead shot deed. The cost of using this deed cannot be reduced with the Signature Deed feat, the true grit class feature, or any similar effect.																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.51
Lucky				KEY:Lucky ~ MYSTERIOUS STRANGER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a mysterious stranger gains a +1 luck bonus on Will saving throws.

PISTOLERO			KEY:Gunslinger Archetype ~ PISTOLERO		CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.GunslingerArchetype					DESC:While most gunslingers have favorite f irearms, there are those rare ones who choose to specialize in onehanded firearms exclusively. These gunslingers are called pistoleros. While they lack the flexibility of being able to pick up any kind of firearm and use it with reasonable proficiency, they are crackerjack shots with pistols and similar firearms. Their skill and aim with these firearms at close range is second to none, and they rarely misfire with these weapons.

Up Close and Deadly	KEY:Up Close and Deadly ~ PISTOLERO			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.GunslingerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, when the pistolero hits a target with a one-handed firearm that is not making a scatter shot, she can spend 1 grit point to deal 1d6 points of extra damage on a hit. If she misses with the attack, she grazes the target, dealing half the extra damage anyway. She must choose to spend the grit point before she makes the attack roll. This is precision damage and is not multiplied if the attack is a critical hit. This precision damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, to 3d6 at 10th level, to 4d6 at 15th level, and to 5d6 at 20th level. This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage. This deed replaces the deadeye deed.																	SOURCEPAGE:p.51

Negating Critical		KEY:Negating Critical ~ ICONOCLAST		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpellLike.Archetype.InquisitorArchetype		DESC:At 14th level, when an iconoclast confirms a critical hit, the creature she hit must succeed at a Fortitude save at DC 10 + 1/2 the iconoclast's caster level + the iconoclast's Wisdom modifier for each non-artifact magic item the target is wearing or carrying.

Foil Casting		KEY:Foil Casting ~ SPELLBREAKER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.InquisitorArchetype		DESC:At 3rd level, when an opponent tries to cast an arcane spell within a spellbreaker's threatened area, the DC for that caster to cast defensively increases by 2. This increase stacks with the effects of the Disruptive feat (see page 112 of the Core Rulebook). Furthermore, the spellbreaker knows where to hit foes to foil casting from a distance. Each time she hits an arcane spellcaster or a creature that uses spell-like abilities with a ranged weapon attack, the DC of any Concentration checks the caster makes increases by 2 for 1 round. This ability replaces solo tactics.																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.53
Impervious			KEY:Impervious ~ SPELLBREAKER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.InquisitorArchetype	DESC:At 20th level, a spellbreaker becomes immune to the effects of a single school of arcane magic. That school of magic must be the first one she picked for defense against magic (see above). Neither harmful nor helpful arcane spells of that school have an effect on the spellbreaker.

Spell Scent			KEY:Spell Scent ~ WITCH HUNTER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.InquisitorArchetype					DESC:At 6th level, the witch hunter learns how to sense unique spell signatures, and can follow the trail of a cast spell or spell effect cast back to its source. Once per day, when the witch hunter comes into contact with or is exposed to a spell effect or a magic item, she can spend a full-round action to examine the spell effect or magic item, and then gains the effect of a locate creature spell (Core Rulebook 305). She can do this even if the spell effect was instantaneous, but must start her examination within 1 round after she experienced the spell's effect. Instead of locating a known creature, the witch hunter locates the caster of the spell effect or magic item she examined.

Bastion of Good			KEY:Bastion of Good ~ SACRED SHIELD				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.PaladinArchetype		DESC:At 1st level, a sacred shield can call upon the powers of good to defend her and her allies against evil. This ability functions as smite evil, except that the paladin gains no benefit on attack or damage rolls against her target. Instead, any attacks the target makes against allies within 10 feet of the paladin deal half damage. Attacks against the paladin deal full damage, but the paladin gains a deflection bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus increases by +1 for every four paladin levels (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). As with smite evil, if the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, her bastion of good ability is wasted with no effect.

At 11th level, this protection expands to cover any allies within 10 feet and the radiance increases to the effects of a daylight spell. At 20th level, any allies within 20 feet are protected. Using this ability consumes two uses of the sacred shield's lay on hands ability, and the effects last for 3 rounds plus a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (if any). This ability replaces channel positive energy.																																																																																																																																																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.65
Divine Bond				KEY:Divine Bond ~ SACRED SHIELD				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.PaladinArchetype		DESC:At 5th level, instead of forming a divine bond with her weapon or a mount, a sacred shield forms a bond with her shield. As a standard action, a sacred shield can enhance her shield by calling on the aid of a celestial spirit. This bond lasts for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the shield to shed light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the shield a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the shield gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the shield, stacking with existing enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities - arrow deflection, bashing, blinding, fortification (any), reflecting, and spell resistance (any). The reflecting enhancement may be used once each time the sacred shield makes use of her divine bond. Adding these armor special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost (see Table 15-4 on page 485 of the Core Rulebook). These bonuses are added to any properties the shield already has, but duplicate special abilities do not grant any extra benefit. If the shield is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the shield is used by anyone other than the sacred shield, but it resumes giving bonuses if the sacred shield resumes using the shield. A sacred shield can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of four times per day at 17th level. If a shield with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the sacred shield loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this period, the sacred shield takes a -1 penalty to her armor class and on saving throws.	SOURCEPAGE:p.65

Hunter's Bond		KEY:Hunter's Bond ~ BATTLE SCOUT		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, when a battle scout gains the hunter's bond ability, he must choose to bond with his companions.

Advantageous Terrain	KEY:Advantageous Terrain ~ BATTLE SCOUT	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 5th level, when a battle scout is within one of his favorite terrains, he can spend up to 3 consecutive rounds studying an area of terrain to gain the benefits below. Each round of studying terrain is a standard action. During the first round of studying terrain, the battle scout designates a 60-foot-radius-burst area from a single square within line of sight. Depending on how many rounds the battle scout spends studying the area, he or his allies gain the following benefits for 10 minutes per ranger level he possesses. (For example, if he spends 2 rounds, he or his allies gain the first two benefits.) 1st Round - Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks while within the advantageous terrain area. 2nd Round - Allies within line of sight and that can hear the battle scout gain a +2 on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while within the advantageous terrain area. 3rd Round - The battle scout's movement is not hampered by difficult terrain while within the advantageous terrain area. Furthermore, the battle scout can take 10 on Climb and Swim checks and checks to jump while within the area, even when in immediate danger or distracted.

Infiltration		KEY:Infiltration ~ BATTLE SCOUT		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 10th level, once per day, a battle scout can choose a single terrain type that is not his favored terrain.

SOURCEPAGE:p.66
Superior Tactics		KEY:Superior Tactics ~ BATTLE SCOUT		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 15th level, once per day, after a battle scout and his allies roll initiative, the battle scout can arrange his and his allies' initiative rolls any way he wishes. If he has already taken 3 rounds to scout out the terrain with his advantageous terrain ability and both he and his allies are within the effect area, they gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks.

DEEP WALKER			KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ DEEP WALKER		CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:Some rangers devote their lives to the woods, becoming hunters, protectors, and wilderness guides among its diverse terrain types. The deep walker is instead a master of the strange terrain of the deep earth, exploring its caverns and caves, becoming a master of the dark corridors most surface dwellers fear to explore-and perhaps the reason they fear to explore them.

Every 5 levels thereafter, the deep walker gains an additional +3 on each of those checks while underground (to a maximum of +11 at 18th level). This ability replaces favored terrain.																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.66
Rock Hopper			KEY:Rock Hopper ~ DEEP WALKER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 7th level, a deep walker instinctively grasps for the most stable surfaces and holds on tighter while moving over underground rock and stone.

FALCONER			KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ FALCONER		CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:Rangers have always enjoyed a special bond with a specific animal, but the falconer takes this bond to a deeper level. Falconers begin with their companion earlier than other rangers, and have the ability to teach their companions special tricks.																																																																																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Feathered Companion ~ FALCONER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Hunter's Bond ~ FALCONER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=4	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Swoop for the Kill ~ FALCONER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=6
#	PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Ranger Archetype ~ FALCONER],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.Rangerx]

Feathered Companion	KEY:Feathered Companion ~ FALCONER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, a falconer earns the trust and companionship of a bird of prey. The bird can be of any type of large hunting or scavenging bird (even a vulture). This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability (which is part of the nature bond class feature), but the falconer must take the bird animal companion, and that companion has only half the normal hit points. The falconer cannot teach the bird of prey the work trick, but can teach it either the roam or distract trick for free. Whichever trick the falconer does not pick then can be picked as a trick later. Roam (DC 15) - The falconer can let his animal companion loose to roam and forage. He must let it roam for no more than a week. When the falconer lets it roam, it agrees to return to the place he let it loose within the time period he designates. Distract (DC 20; bird only) - The animal companion flutters wildly around any enemy it would normally attack with the attack trick. It makes an attack roll against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy is shaken. This ability replaces wild empathy.																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.67
Hunter's Bond		KEY:Hunter's Bond ~ FALCONER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, a falconer must select an animal companion when he gains hunter's bond. He does not gain a new companion at 4th level; rather, his feathered companion gains full hit points.																																																																																																																																																																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.67
Swoop for the Kill	KEY:Swoop for the Kill ~ FALCONER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 6th level, when outdoors, a falconer can direct his feathered companion to strike an enemy from high above. His feathered companion gains the following trick as a bonus trick. Swooping Charge (DC 20; bird) - The falconer's bird companion flies up and then swoops down into a charge. To perform this trick, the companion must be able to fly, and it must be outdoors or someplace with enough room for the bird to fly great distances in (a grand cathedral may have enough room, but dungeons usually do not). It spends a full-round action flying to a high vantage point, and on the next round makes a charge attack upon an enemy the falconer designates. If that charge attack hits, the bird deals 2d4 points of damage instead of 1d4 with its bite and gains a ?4 critical modifier when making the attack. If the bird hits, the target is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces the combat style feat the ranger gains at 6th level.																																																										SOURCEPAGE:p.67

TROPHY HUNTER		KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ TROPHY HUNTER	CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:Some rangers have taken up the mysteries of black powder in order to become big game hunters. Finding firearms useful for taking down large and dangerous prey, they enter the fight with the crack of black powder fire, often ranging far and wide in their safaris and searches for ever-more-dangerous denizens of the wild to track, study, appreciate-and kill. While this might strike some as going against the ranger's usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature's grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle-the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed-are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.																																																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.67	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Improved Tracking ~ TROPHY HUNTER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Firearm Style ~ TROPHY HUNTER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=2	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Hunter's Aim ~ TROPHY HUNTER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=4
#	PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	PREMULT:1,[PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,Ranger Archetype ~ TROPHY HUNTER],[!PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Archetype,TYPE.Rangerx]

Improved Tracking		KEY:Improved Tracking ~ TROPHY HUNTER	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, a trophy hunter gains a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks when following or identifying tracks. When he tracks, he can also attempt a Knowledge (nature) check at DC 15. On a success, the trophy hunter can discern the type and condition of any animals or magical beasts he tracks. By studying their tracks, the trophy hunter is able to identify a rough approximation of their health, maneuverability, and their general behavior as compared to the norm. This ability replaces wild empathy.																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.67
Firearm Style		KEY:Firearm Style ~ TROPHY HUNTER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:At 2nd level, a trophy hunter gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat, and can use any 1st-level gunslinger deed (page 10). At every four levels thereafter, the trophy hunter can take a grit feat or select a gunslinger deed of his level or lower, ranger's choice. This ability replaces combat feat style.																																																																																																																																																																				SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Hunter's Aim		KEY:Hunter's Aim ~ TROPHY HUNTER		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, a trophy hunter gains a specific understanding of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of his favored enemies, and his careful study of these enemies reveals the best way to hurt them. When the trophy hunter makes a firearm attack against a favored enemy, he can target touch AC in the first two range increments of his firearm. This ability stacks with other effects that increase the range increments to target touch AC, adding one range increment to the effect. This ability replaces hunter's bond.																																																																																																																																SOURCEPAGE:p.68

WARDEN			KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ WARDEN			CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:All rangers have a bond with the wilderness, but the warden may have the strongest. This protector sits guard in the middle of the wilderness, keeping a lookout for any dangers that might spill from the deeper wilderness beyond, and protecting civilization from the savagery of nature-and vice versa. His long weeks, months, and sometimes years of isolation cause him to "hear" what the land is saying. Not all are crazy.

Live in Comfort		KEY:Live in Comfort ~ WARDEN			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 2nd level, a warden is truly at home within his favored terrains. He knows all the signs of the wilderness. He rarely gets lost. He can easily live off the land in comfort, and can provide for companions. The warden can take 10 on any Survival check involving any of his favored terrains, even when in immediate danger and distracted. If the warden is not in immediate danger and distracted, he can take 20 even if the check has a penalty for failure. This ability replaces all combat style feats.																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Terrain Bond		KEY:Terrain Bond ~ WARDEN			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 4th level, a warden forms a bond with the land itself, enabling him to direct others in such terrain. When in his favored terrain, the warden grants all allies within line of sight and that can hear him a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they travel with him, the warden's allies leave no trail and can't be tracked. The warden can choose for the group to leave a trail, or even for specific members of the group to leave a trail if he so desires. This ability replaces hunter's bond.																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.68
Able Explorer		KEY:Able Explorer ~ WARDEN			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Archetype.RangerArchetype	DESC:At 5th level, when making an Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, Ride, or Swim check in any of his favored terrains, a warden can make two skill checks and take the higher.

This ability replaces the ranger's fifth favorite enemy.																																																																																																																																																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.68

WILD STALKER		KEY:Ranger Archetype ~ WILD STALKER		CATEGORY:Archetype	COST:0	TYPE:Archetype.RangerArchetype					DESC:Civilization grows stronger and more decadent with each passing year. It tears into unclaimed wilderness and destroys the fragile ecology in its constant push for expansion and exploitation. The wild stalker forsakes the bonds of community and lives in the trackless wilds far from others of his kind, or perhaps grew up there, never knowing of civilization as anything more than his enemy. He drives pioneers back to civilization and strives to keep the land unspoiled.																																																																																																																																							SOURCEPAGE:p.68	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Strong Senses ~ WILD STALKER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=1	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Uncanny Dodge ~ WILD STALKER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=2	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Rage of the Wild ~ WILD STALKER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=4	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Rage Powers ~ WILD STALKER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=5	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|Wild Talents ~ WILD STALKER|PRECLASS:1,Ranger=6

This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 1st (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level, or +7 if the character did not gain low-light vision from this ability). This ability replaces the ranger's first favored enemy ability.
