# Spellslinger Abilities
Arcane Gun		KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Spellslinger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellslinger Gun Choice|1
Arcane Gun		KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Display			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	CHOOSE:STRING|One Gun|Two Guns	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	AUTO:FEAT|Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Firearms)	DESC:The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat, and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal one-handed or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger's hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired Classes through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a x3 critical hit multiplier.&nl; A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun's enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells' attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.&nl; A spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun, even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed.&nl;Spellslinger Choice %1.&nl; This ability replaces arcane bond.|%LIST
Gunsmith		KEY:Gunsmith ~ Spellslinger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	DESC:The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a Gunslinger (see page 9) gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a Gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun.&nl; This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.
Mage Bullets	KEY:Mage Bullets ~ Spellslinger		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his arcane gun attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious, and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements.&nl; This ability replaces cantrips, but the spellslinger gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.	SPELLKNOWN:CLASS|Wizard=1|Detect Magic,Read Magic
School of the Gun	KEY:School of the Gun ~ Spellslinger	CATEGORY:Special Ability	BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellslinger Opposition School Choice|4
School of the Gun	KEY:School of the Gun ~ Display		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality	CHOOSE:SCHOOLS|ALL	MULT:YES	STACK:NO	DESC:The rigor and care required by arcane guns is so great that a spellslinger forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. A spellslinger who prepares a spell from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the spellslinger takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite.&nl; Chosen Opposition Schools, %1.&nl; This ability replaces arcane school.|%LIST

# Alchemist Discoveries
Breath Weapon Bomb*	KEY:Discovery ~ Breath Weapon Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6	DESC:Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, you can draw the components, drink them, mix them within your body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from your bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = %1) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity.|AlchemistBombDC
Explosive Missile		KEY:Discovery ~ Explosive Missile		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,4	DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate.
Immolation Bomb		KEY:Discovery ~ Immolation Bomb		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,3	DESC:When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target’s body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb’s effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist’s turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb’s direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater.
Nauseating Flesh		KEY:Discovery ~ Nauseating Flesh		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	DESC:The alchemist’s body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.
Poison Conversion		KEY:Discovery ~ Poison Conversion		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.AlchemistDiscovery.Extraordinary			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,6	DESC:By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab.
Siege Bomb			KEY:Discovery ~ Siege Bomb			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.AlchemistDiscovery.Supernatural			PREVARGTEQ:AlchemistLVL,12	PREABILITY:1,CATEGORY=Special Ability,Discovery ~ Explosive Bomb		DESC:As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege weapon with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist’s next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist’s bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb’s damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage (or another energy type, if the alchemist is capable of modifying his bombs in that way) each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.
