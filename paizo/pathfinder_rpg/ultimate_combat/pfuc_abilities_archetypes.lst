A dervish dancer cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a dervish dancer can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action.

Black Market Connections	KEY:Black Market Connections ~ Rogue Talent	CATEGORY:Special Ability						TYPE:Extraordinary.RogueTalent				DESC:A rogue with this talent gains better access to magic items from black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater (see Table 15-1 on page 461 of the Core Rulebook) for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful Diplomacy check, the rogue can treat the settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful check, the rogue can also sell stolen items on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the rogue does something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week. Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the authorities to the rogue's presence in an act of reprisal for spooking the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities.

Hide in Plain Sight		KEY:Hide in Plain Sight ~ Advanced Rogue Talent	CATEGORY:Special Ability						TYPE:Extraordinary.RogueTalent	PREVARGTEQ:RogueTalentLVL,10			DESC:A rogue with this talent can select a single terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. She is a master at hiding in that terrain, and while within that terrain, she can use the Stealth skill to hide, even while being observed. A rogue may take this advanced talent more than once, each time selecting a different terrain from the favored terrain list.																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.71
Rumormonger				KEY:Rumormonger ~ Advanced Rogue Talent		CATEGORY:Special Ability						TYPE:Extraordinary.RogueTalent	PREVARGTEQ:RogueTalentLVL,10			DESC:A rogue with this talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small town or larger settlement by making a Bluff check. She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other competing theory involving the rumor's subject to take hold.																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.71
Unwitting Ally			KEY:Unwitting Ally ~ Advanced Rogue Talent	CATEGORY:Special Ability						TYPE:Extraordinary.RogueTalent	PREVARGTEQ:RogueTalentLVL,10			DESC:A rogue with this talent can spend a swift action to attempt to make an opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until the beginning of the rogue's next turn. The opponent must be able to hear and see the rogue, and the rogue must succeed at a Bluff check opposed by the opponent's Sense Motive. If the check succeeds, the opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the check succeeds, the rogue cannot use this trick again on the same opponent for the next 24 hours. If the rogue fails the check by 5 or more, she cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of the failed attempt for 24 hours.

Weapon Snatcher			KEY:Weapon Snatcher ~ Advanced Rogue Talent	CATEGORY:Special Ability						TYPE:Extraordinary.RogueTalent	PREVARGTEQ:RogueTalentLVL,10			DESC:A rogue with this talent can make a Sleight of Hand check in place of a combat maneuver check when attempting to disarm an opponent.

A few wizards take up the secrets of the bomb, however, fusing alchemy with their already considerable magical power.

Bomb				KEY:Bomb ~ ARCANE BOMBER			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.WizardArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, the arcane bomber gains an ability nearly identical to the alchemist's bomb ability (Advanced Player's Guide 28). Unlike the alchemist, at 1st level, the arcane bomber chooses one type of energy from the following list: acid, cold, fire, and electricity. He can throw bombs of that type, but cannot modify them with discoveries. This ability stacks with the alchemist bomb ability to determine the level of bomb damage, but an arcane bomber that becomes an alchemist does not gain that class's bomb ability, nor does an alchemist that becomes an arcane bomber gain this bomb ability. This ability replaces arcane bond.																																SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Spellblast Bombs		KEY:Spellblast Bombs ~ ARCANE BOMBER	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.WizardArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, as a swift action, an arcane bomber can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next bomb he throws during his turn. When he does, he gains a bonus to hit with the next bomb he throws before the end of his turn equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to twice the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the arcana bomber gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.																																																			SOURCEPAGE:p.74
School of the Bomb	KEY:School of the Bomb ~ ARCANE BOMBER	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.WizardArchetype				DESC:The creation and use of bombs is often so engrossing or intellectually taxing that an arcane bomber forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. An arcane bomber who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the arcane bomber takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools. This ability replaces arcane school.																																																		SOURCEPAGE:p.74

Siege Engineer		KEY:Siege Engineer ~ SIEGE MAGE		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.WizardArchetype				DESC:At 1st level, the siege mage gains Siege Engineer (see page 118) as a bonus feat, even though he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat. This ability replaces scribe scroll.																																																																																																												SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Siege Engine Bond		KEY:Siege Engine Bond ~ SIEGE MAGE		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.WizardArchetype	DESC:At 1st level, a siege mage can bond with a single siege engine within 30 feet and line of sight as a standard action. He can utilize the power of this link to aim and fire the siege engine remotely (as long as he's within 30 feet), though it still requires a crew to reload the siege engine. At 10th level, he can reload, aim, and fire the siege engine purely by the power of this link, and no longer needs a crew to control the siege engine. It still takes the normal required amount of time and actions to control a siege engine in this manner. This ability replaces arcane bond. The siege mage can end this bond with a free action. A siege mage can bond with a siege engine in this manner a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) but can only be bonded with one siege engine at a time.	SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Empower Siege Engine	KEY:Empower Siege Engine ~ SIEGE MAGE	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Archetype.WizardArchetype	DESC:As a swift action, a siege mage can sacrifice one of his spells to empower the next attack he makes before the end of his turn with a siege engine he is bonded with. When he does, the siege engine attack gains a bonus on its attack roll or targeting roll equal to the level of the spell he sacrificed, and a bonus to damage equal to 3 ? the level of the spell. This ability replaces cantrips, but the siege mage gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.																																															SOURCEPAGE:p.74
Siege School		KEY:Siege School ~ SIEGE MAGE			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Archetype.WizardArchetype				DESC:The strange rituals needed to empower all forms of siege engines takes a level of dedication and perseverance that limits a wizard's time to unlock other arcane mysteries. At 1st level, the siege mage forsakes three schools of magic. Once chosen, these opposition schools cannot be changed. A siege mage who prepares spells from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the siege mage takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools. This ability replaces arcane school.																																						SOURCEPAGE:p.74

# Spellslinger Abilities
Arcane Gun					KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Spellslinger				CATEGORY:Special Ability																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																			BONUS:ABILITYPOOL|Spellslinger Gun Choice|1
Arcane Gun					KEY:Arcane Gun ~ Display				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																										DESC:The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat, and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal one-handed or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger's hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired Classes through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a x3 critical hit multiplier.&nl; A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun's enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell's attack rolls or to the spell's saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells' attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger's space (spellslinger's choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.&nl; A spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun, even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed.&nl;Spellslinger Choice %1.&nl; This ability replaces arcane bond.|%LIST	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:STRING|One Gun|Two Guns	AUTO:FEAT|Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Firearms)
Gunsmith					KEY:Gunsmith ~ Spellslinger				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																																																																																												DESC:The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a Gunslinger (see page 9) gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a Gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun.&nl; This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.
Mage Bullets				KEY:Mage Bullets ~ Spellslinger			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural																																																																																																										DESC:A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his arcane gun attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious, and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements.&nl; This ability replaces cantrips, but the spellslinger gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.

School of the Gun				KEY:School of the Gun ~ Display			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality																																																																																																												DESC:The rigor and care required by arcane guns is so great that a spellslinger forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. A spellslinger who prepares a spell from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the spellslinger takes a -4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite.&nl; Chosen Opposition Schools, %1.&nl; This ability replaces arcane school.|%LIST																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																															STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SCHOOLS|ALL
