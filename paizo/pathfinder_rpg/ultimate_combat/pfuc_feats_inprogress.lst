dice you can access to further damage creatures normally
harmed by the energy you are channeling-undead for

to be used as extra damage dice if you hit. Your target can

using it to grapple an opponent.

opponent, you deal your whip's weapon damage rather
than your unarmed strike damage.
Free Hands: You take no penalty on your combat maneuver
check for having fewer than two hands free when you use
your whip to grapple.
Reach: Rather than pulling your grappled opponent
adjacent to you when you successfully grapple and when
you move the grapple, you must keep him within your
whip's reach minus his own reach to maintain the grapple.
If the difference in reach is less than 0, such as is the case
for a Medium whip wielder and a Gargantuan creature, you
cannot grapple that opponent with your whip. If you have
to pull a creature adjacent to you to grapple it with your
whip, you still provoke an attack of opportunity from that
opponent unless you have the Improved Grapple feat.

use your whip to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you
have grappled rather than pinned, you take only a -5 penalty
