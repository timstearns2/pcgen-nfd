# Make Orc a Base class so it gets Traits and Archetypes.
# Make Orc a PC class so it sorts first in the Race dropdown on the overview tab 
# Set Orc to CR 1/2 as appropriate for PC characters at level 1.
# There are no alternative racial traits, so do not bother with Default Racial Abilitities things.
