Sihedron Ring
Aura moderate abjuration and illusion; CL 9th
Slot —; Price 35,000 gp
Description
This otherwise plain gold ring is adorned with seven black sapphires
arranged in the shape of a tiny Sihedron rune. These rings were
given to agents and allies of the runelords as badges of office and
tokens of appreciation for their work—sometimes, they were given
as bribes to those a runelord was attempting to win to his cause.
Unlike the more common Sihedron medallion, a runelord has no
special link to a Sihedron ring—such a link would undermine the
item’s diplomatic value, since many of those who wore them were
strong-willed and powerful creatures in their own right.
A Sihedron ring grants a +3 deflection bonus to AC, a
+3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and protects you with
endure elements. At will, as a standard action, you can use the
Sihedron ring to change the appearance of your clothing or armor
into any other kind of clothing or armor. The actual clothing and
armor worn retain all their properties (including weight) when
glamered—only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true
nature of your adornments.

Chellan, Sword of Greed
Minor Artifact
Aura strong transmutation; CL 16th
Slot —; Weight 25 lb.
Description
Of the Seven Blades of Conviction wielded by the runelords’
champions, weapons known as the Alara’hai to the Thassilonians,
the sword of greed was the most extravagant, for it was made of
magically hardened gold, tempered to the strength of adamantine
yet retaining its luster. Although made of gold, Chellan functions
as an adamantine weapon for purposes of overcoming damage
reduction and bypassing hardness. Chellan is a +5 keen scimitar,
and its dense weight allows it to damage foes as if it were one size
category larger than its actual size. It can be properly wielded only
by characters with a Strength of 18 or higher—all other characters
must either wield it as a two-handed weapon or take a –2 penalty
on attack rolls with the weapon.
Whenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must make a
DC 20 Fortitude save or be slowed as the spell (CL 16th). If the
sword instead scores a critical hit, the target must make a DC 25
Fortitude save or be turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to
stone. Characters turned to crystal by Chellan appear to be made
of ruby, diamond, or some other valuable gem, but are in fact
merely colored quartz of little value to the looter.


Anima Focus
Minor Artifact
Aura strong transmutation; CL 20th
Slot —; Weight 5 lb.
Description
This powerful artifact was originally created in the twilight
years of Thassilon by Karzoug to serve as an anchor for the soul
lens, allowing it to draw power from the plane on which the
anima lens resided in addition to the plane on which the soul
lens itself resides. When carried, the anima focus also allows
its owner to temporarily shed his mortal flesh and become
ghostlike, as if using the spell ethereal jaunt. The lens can be
used to cast this spell up to three times per day.

Robes of Xin-Shalast
Aura strong abjuration and conjuration; CL 16th
Slot robe; Price 198,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
DESCRIPTION
The robes of Xin’Shalast grant a +6 armor bonus and spell resistance 24.
Fashioned for an archmage, the robes are also meant to aid and accentuate
their wearer’s spellcasting ability. Thus, the robes cause the wearer to cast
all spells at +1 caster level, while two of the robe’s pockets function as
handy haversacks. The wearer of these robes is immune to the effects of
the occluding field that surrounds the Spires of Xin-Shalast, and can exist
comfortably in all high altitudes, including within the death zone.

Runewell Amulet
Minor Artifact
Aura strong transmutation; CL 20th
Slot amulet; Price —
DESCRIPTION
This amulet of gold and red crystal grants the wearer a +5 enhancement
bonus to his natural armor bonus. In addition, the wearer becomes
attuned to both the runewell of greed and the soul lens that controls it.
While within the confines of the runewell, the wearer does not
age and has no need for food or water. In addition, he can move about
the interior of the runewell at a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect
maneuverability. The wearer of the necklace is sustained by the souls
absorbed by the runewell and, as a result, gains fast healing 10.


Sihedron Tome
Minor Artifact
Aura strong transmutation; CL 16th
Slot —; Price —; Weight 1 lb.
DESCRIPTION
A useful lesser artifact said to have been crafted
by a dragon in the service of Emperor Xin,
the Sihedron tome holds infinite pages
for wizards to inscribe spells
upon. In addition to potentially
holding libraries worth of
arcane knowledge, any wizard
who prepares spells from the
Sihedron Tome may prepare
bonus spells as if his Intelligence
were 6 points higher. This is not an
actual bonus to Intelligence and grants
the user no additional benefit. Currently, the
book is filled with arcane formulas for every spell Karzoug
has memorized, plus 2d12 others (mostly from the school of
transmutation and none from the schools of enchantment or illusion).


Talons of Leng
Aura strong transmutation; CL 15th
Slot gloves; Price 67,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.
DESCRIPTION
Finely laid gold filigree lines these ornately worked gloves. Once worn, the
talons of Leng grant the wearer two natural claw attacks, both with a +3
enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage. A hit from one of the talons
inflicts 1d4 points of damage. On a critical hit, the talons inflict ×3 damage,
and force the victim to make a DC 20 Will save. Failing this save renders the
target permanently insane (as per the spell insanity), while success leaves the
target confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.
The wearer of the talons of Leng is immune to the spells confusion
and insanity, and any ability that produces similar effects. For as long
as he wears the talons, however, his Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien
voices constantly whisper through his head.
The talons of Leng do not interfere with spellcasting, the use of
handheld items, or wielding other weapons (though a wielder cannot
make an attack with a claw that’s holding another weapon or item). If the
wielder attacks only with the talons, they are treated as a primary attack,
but if he attacks with a weapon or other natural attack, the claws are
treated as secondary attacks and suffer a –5 penalty to their attack roll.
