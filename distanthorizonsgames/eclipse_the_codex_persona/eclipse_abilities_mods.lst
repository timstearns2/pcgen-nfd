###COMMENT: Use Cost to Determine 'CP used'; For Corrupted or Specialized it will require some thought in application.
# FREQs Required by Set to make functionality more complete
#NAME Must Be Unique for count to work correctly - NEED new tag in Count called 'KEY=' to look at actual Key Name, currently NAME= looks at the first Name in the Line, and ignores KEY entries.

# Bugs:
#	CHOOSE:USERINPUT is outputting in OS; All other CHOOSE Tags are not outputting - Bug Report Filed
#	SEARCH Function resets after apply an ability forcing you to insert another letter to get the results back up; fix so the Search remains valid until the Search is cleared.

###Comment: Use this for all abilities granted to every character of the point buy system

COST:6	SOURCELONG:Psychic Handbook	SOURCEPAGE:p.43	BENEFIT:STRAIN 1. Once per round when you would normally be hit by a ranged weapon, you may make a Reflex saving throw against a DC of 20 (if the ranged weapon has an enhancement attack bonus, the DC increases by that amount). If you succeed, you reflexively apport the weapon away from you, causing it to miss. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to apport an incoming weapon does not count as an action. You cannot apport spells or ranged weapons created by spells. You can apport particularly large ranged weapons, such as rocks hurled by catapults or giants, but the strain cost is increased by the object's mass (see p. 22). NOTE- You must must be able to see the incoming weapon in order to apport it, so invisible ranged weapons cannot be apported, nor can ranged attacks such as bullets, which simply move too fast to be seen.

(Only a level three spell, but - at this level of Charisma - it's far too useful to pass up. Wait! I can assume a more advanced version, which will also include the level one effects of Ward of Light and Wrath of Heaven. At caster level forty, those will have hit their limits of a +6 Sacred Bonus to Armor Class and a +6 Sacred Bonus to Attacks and Damage. That would still only be level five or six - but it's not quite so wasteful).
