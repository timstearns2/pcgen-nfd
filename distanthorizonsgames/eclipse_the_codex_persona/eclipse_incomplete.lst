#Original Entry: Andrew Maitland

+2 ECL Evil Outsider Template (94 CP out of 95 available):

    *
      Str +6, Dex +6, Con +6, Int +6, and Cha +6: 180 CP.
    *
      One Level of Growth: Size Large: +8 Str, -2 Dex, +4 Con, +2 Natural Armor, -1 AC and To Hit versus medium-sized creatures, 48 CP.
    *
      Fast Learner x2 (Specialized in Skills, +4 SP/Level, 12 CP)
    *

    *
      Skill Bonuses: +8 on Listen and Spot (16 CP)
    *
      Occult Sense/Darkvision (6 CP)
    *
      Mindspeech (6 CP)
    *
      Spell Resistance of (5 + Level) (6 CP)
    *
      Returning (Specialized: must be slain on home plane or can come back after a year, 3 CP)
    *
      Fortunately – or unfortunately – for them, the entire template is both Specialized and Corrupted: The user is an obvious hideous demon, is inherently evil (and vulnerable to things that target evil creatures regardless of its current alignment), is vulnerable to spells that affect outsiders, and cannot normally be Raised or Resurrected. One-third cost.
