#Martial Arts Description Abilities
Nightmare Storm Martial Art	CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:A1	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput		DESC:This martial art focuses on channeling negative energy into the user's hands and weapons, allowing him or her to cleave through armor to hit more accurately, absorb the energy of incoming blows with his or her bare skin, sense the life energy of foes, cause them to crumple when struck, and to disrupt their bodies with a mere touch. It is, however, a terrible strain on the metabolism of a living creature	DESC:Basic Abilities; Attack 4, Defenses 3, Strike, Synergy/Channeling Checks. Advanced and Master Techniques; Blind-Fight, Mighty Blow, Reach, and Weapon Kata (Pick). Occult Techniques; Inner Strength x2, Paralyze, and Touch Strike.
Obsidian Heart Kung Fu		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:A1	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput		DESC:Obsidian Heart Kung Fu is a purely mystical form which progresses from simple evasion and awareness of the user's surroundings (basic Defenses and Mind Like Moon) on to generating a seething aura of negative energy around the user - an amorphous, quasi-solid thing which lashes out to strike at opponents or deflect incoming attacks while the user remains virtually immobile. At it's highest levels, the user may even support or move his or her own body with the aura, allowing him or her to accomplish some fairly impressive feats - although this comes at a considerable cost to his or her energy reserves. Basics; Attack 4, Defenses 4, Power 2, Strike, Synergy/Hide, Synergy/Move Silently. Advanced and Master Techniques; Reach, Mind Like Moon (may avoid being surprised or caught flat-footed with a DC 15 reflex save), Breaking (may add martial arts skill to the strength check when trying to break objects), Expertise (May transfer up to five points from attack bonus to armor class as a dodge bonus if making an attack). Occult Techniques; Inner Strength, Ki Block, Light Foot, and Vanishing.
Sardorian Archery Style		CATEGORY:Special Ability	SORTKEY:A1	TYPE:MartialArtsOutput		DESC:The Sardorian Style focuses on military discipline. Ignore distractions, remain calm, draw smoothly, focus on your target, release, and repeat. Trust your allies to keep the enemy troops off you and use volley fire to deal with major opponents.  Unfortunately, since arrows have distinct limitations as weapons (at least for more-or-less normal people in a d20 universe), be prepared to fall back and switch to a different weapon.  Basics; Attack 4, Power 2, Synergy/Craft (Bowyer), Synergy/Hide, and Toughness 2. Advanced and Master Techniques; Deflect Arrows, Rapid Shot, Mighty Blow, and +1d6 Sneak Attack. Occult Techniques; Inner Strength, Ki Focus, Serpent Strike, and Touch Strike.


# Borez Anek Abilities

# Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal
Rithian Blademaster Package Deal	COST:0	KEY:Rithian Blade Master	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.PackageDeals	DESC:The Rithian Blademasters are one of the oldest and most respected warrior-orders of the western realm. While they have several rival schools, the purity of the Rithian techniques is unquestioned and the honor of their school has been fiercely maintained across the centuries. More than a few great champions have come from their halls. They will NOT be pleased to hear that an undead horror is using, and abusing, their techniques, and will certainly sponsor efforts to eliminate such a dishonor.	ABILITY:Character Points|AUTOMATIC|Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal	COST:0	
Block/Melee (4 CP) with Multiple (4 CP) and Riposte (4 CP), all Corrupted/only usable while using a sword.	KEY:Rithian Blade Master ~ Package Deal		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput		DESC:A Rithian-trained fighter can attempt (by spending an Attack of Opportunity and making a DC 20 Reflex Save) to block up to sixty points of damage from a successful melee attack up to twice per round - and if they do successfully block an attack (and have another Attack of Opportunity available to use), they get an immediate counterstrike at their full BAB. Given Borez's horrific Reflex save, he can generally pretty well count on deflecting two melee attacks - and getting two extra attacks of his own - every round that he's in melee as long as his opponents can hit him at all.


# Knight of Hades Template
# Greater Undead Package (64 CP).

#   All of these effects are Specialized: the user becomes an undead horror, seeks to prey on the living, becomes vulnerable to being Turned (Channeling), and will find it essentially impossible to turn away from evil without dying. This does mean that a couple of the defenses are double-specialized, but - in this case - the effects don't overlap, and so I'll give permission for that.

No Constitution score														KEY:Knight of Hades ~ No Con							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate.AnekBorez		DESC:(0 CP) Includes immunity to ability damage (including all poisons), ability drain, energy drain, and effects requiring fortitude saves unless they work on objects or are harmless. Does not breathe, eat, or sleep, cannot tire, and can move, work, or remain alert indefinitely. They cannot be Raised or Reincarnated and are instantly destroyed at 0 HP.
Negative Energy Metabolism													KEY:Knight of Hades ~ NEM							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:(0 CP) Undead are healed and enhanced by negative energy and harmed or hindered by positive energy, instead of the reverse. As a side effect, they regain 10 HP whenever they would normally suffer a negative level, but treat Positive Levels as negative levels.
Finesse																KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Finesse							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:(3 CP) May substitute their (Cha Mod) for their (Con Mod) when calculating hit points and related effects such as concentration checks.

BONUS:COMBAT|AC|DefenderNaturalArmor|TYPE=NaturalArmor.STACK		BONUS:VAR|DefenderNaturalArmor|(2*TL)/5	DEFINE:DefenderNaturalArmor|0

#This sub-package is suitable for any character who wants to be undead. Just apply it as a +2 ECL acquired template and get some way to heal your injuries

#Knights of Hades add the following items to the basic Greater Undead Package, leaving them subject to the same limitations. This does require that the limitations be upgraded a bit though; the Knights of Hades are major champions of the Dark Powers - and so their activities draw a constant

# Basic Upgrades (+35 CP):

+4 Charisma															KEY:Knight of Hades ~ CHA 4			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:(Half cost in a Template, 12 CP).	BONUS:STAT|CHA|4
Unholy Might														KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Unholy Might		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:Augmented Bonus/adds (Cha Mod) to (Str Mod) for the purposes of combat and other applications of brute force (3 CP).	BONUS:COMBAT|TOHIT,DAMAGE|CHA

Major Privilege/can confirm Witchcraft Pacts and swear followers to the Powers of Darkness	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Privilege		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:(3 CP).

Infernal Command Package (58 CP)													KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Infernal Command Package	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:Newly-recruited Knights of Hades are generally powerful warriors, but usually lack the ability to cast, or effectively counter, spells. To counter this weakness, they are granted the direct command over magical energies. That doesn't give them any particularly sophisticated effects to call on, but it certainly gives them a variety of options.
#
Inherent Spells																KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Inherent Spells							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:12xL1 (12 CP), 8x L2 (15 CP), 8x L3 (17 CP), 8x L4 (17 CP), and 8x L5 (17 CP). All Specialized and Corrupted: Only usable to power Theurgy, immediate commands only, blatantly displays the user's nature when used via a burst of infernal energies (incidentally negating any attempt at stealth), attracts the notice of various powers of light. Caster Level = User's Level, Save DC is Charisma based. Net cost= 26 CP.
Metamagic/Easy and Metamagic/Elemental Manipulation with the Fast modifier and four levels of Streamline	KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Metamagic								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:all Specialized and Corrupted/Only works to Quicken his spells and to change the damage of damage-causing spells to Profane/Negative Energy damage, requires the patronage of the greater powers of the lower planes, who WILL demand regular services and offerings, must possess - and prominently display - a very expensive (2500 GP+) bejeweled unholy symbol to gain this enhancement (14 CP).
Mastery x2/all Theurgy Verb Skills													KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Mastery x2 all Theurgy Verb Skills				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:Specialized for Double Effect (may "Take 20")/Immediate commands only; No long-term enchantments, duration spells, triggered or waiting effects, etc (12 CP).
Augmented Bonus/adds (Cha Mod) to all Theurgy Skills										KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Augmented Bonus/adds Cha Mod to all Theurgy Skills	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:(6 CP). Note that it requires a Cha Mod of at least +3 to use fourth level effects and of at least +5 to use fifth level effects.																																																												BONUS:SKILL|TYPE.Theurgy|CHA
Reflex Action with +8 Bonus Uses													KEY:Knight of Hades ~ Reflex Action								CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.KnightHadesTemplate		DESC:Specialized and Corrupted/only for Theurgy, only allows a single spell to be cast despite the Quickening effect (6 CP).

# That gives our Knights of Hades a total template cost of 160 CP - in +4 ECL territory. If you're converting a character into a Knight of Hades in Eclipse, simply add that to his or her racial package, eliminate any overlapping or conflicting elements (such as a Constitution bonus or Penalty), and see what you wind up with.

#   If you start with a normal human though, you'll still wind up with a +4 ECL modifier.


# Anek Borez Full Package Deal
Anek Borez L8		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Abilities.InstaChar	TEMPLATE:Knight of Hades	ABILITY:Special Ability|AUTOMATIC|TYPE=AnekBorez

Shapeshift, with Shape of Death					KEY:Torc of the Deceiver ~ Shapeshift							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver		DESC:Specialized and Corrupted/only allows shifting into a normal human and is essentially cosmetic. The user seems quite normal and can eat, drink, and enjoy the other pleasures of life  but his or her actual game statistics are unchanged. Unfortunately, any major use of dark powers (such as his Infernal Command abilities) will burn away the quasi-illusory shell like tissue paper (4 CP).
Advanced Shape of Death/the user may become Incorporeal	KEY:Torc of the Deceiver ~ Advanced Shape of Death							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.TorcOfTheDeceiver		DESC:. Corrupted/this state can only be sustained for a few minutes at a time (4 CP).

Note that a sacrifice will only restore two points of this reserve  but Anek can call upon it to unleash a few really impressive spells if he must.

# The Shard of Dust
Channeling/Conversion to a Level Five Effect		KEY:The Shard of Dust ~ Channeling	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.ShardOfDust		DESC: (9 CP). The spell is Dust of Ages  a version of Animate Dead that requires neither gems nor bodies. Unfortunately, the lack of a solid structure means that the creatures called forth are unstable, and will return to the dust from which they were summoned after 1d4+1 hours.





#

Immunity/the distinction between weapons and himself			KEY:ABT ~ Immunity			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.ABT		DESC:(Common, Minor, Major, Specialized in Swords, 3 CP). For true blademasters, their weapons are truly extensions of themselves; attempts to sunder or disarm them are simply treated as normal attacks against hem, and any touch-based powers and "unarmed" combat enhancements or martial arts which they may possess operate through their blades.
Reflex Training/Combat Reflexes Variant					KEY:ABT ~ Reflex				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.ABT		DESC:(6 CP). He gets five attacks of opportunity per round.
Improved Initiative								KEY:ABT ~ Improved Initiative		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.ABT		DESC:+2 (3 CP).

#Innate Enchantment	KEY:AnekBorez ~ 							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.AnekBorez		DESC:11,000 GP effective value, Specialized/all effects are represented by exotic sigils on the skin, his innate magics block the effects of spells and powers that would normally supersede the bonuses they grant, and adding or upgrading enchantments requires strange and exotic ingredients (6 CP). All of his innate enchantments are Spell Level One, Caster Level One, Unlimited-Use Use-Activated, and Personal-Only where relevant. The effects include:
#  o
Chitin Mail						KEY:Innate Enchantment ~ L1 ~ Chitin Mail							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.AnekBorez		DESC:L1 Transmutation. For one minute per level of the caster whatever armor the user is wearing is treated as being one armor category lighter. The maximum dexterity bonus increases by two, the armor check penalty is reduced by two, arcane spell failure goes down by 15% (to a minimum of 5%), and the speed penalty is eliminated (1400 GP).

Enhanced Attributes/+2 Each to Str, Dex, and Cha (4200 GP).
#  o
Light Foot						KEY:AnekBorez ~ 							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.AnekBorez		DESC:L1 Transmutation. The user becomes extremely light on his or her feet, gaining a +30 circumstance bonus on his or her ground movement speed, a +10 circumstance bonus on jump checks, and DR 10 versus Falling Damage [only], for 1d6+2 rounds.

# A great many campaigns will limit characters to 11,000 GP worth of Innate Enchantments - enough to grant characters some interesting and useful powers, and to make them considerably more likely to survive at lower levels, but not enough to make any really major changes at high levels. This batch of abilities would normally cost 880 XP to activate - but we don't really need to worry about that in an NPC.

# Blessings of the Darkness (24 CP).

# Long decades of service and honor as a mortal had earned Borez several blessings - some modest portion of the powers of a true Paladin. Of course - as often happens when a mortal finds such a path too difficult to follow and turns to darkness - the powers of the lower planes were more than happy to replace those lost blessings.


Improved Augmented Bonus: May add his (Cha Mod) to his Reflex Saving Throws, Specialized/only works as long as he continues to enjoy the favor of the dark powers (6 CP).
Improved Augmented Bonus: May add his (Cha Mod) to his Will Saving Throws, Specialized/only works as long as he continues to enjoy the favor of the dark powers (6 CP).
Luck with +4 Bonus Uses (12 CP).

The Lure of the Night	COST:12		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.AnekBorez		DESC:This isn't a tremendous amount of power - although the ability to simply create his weapons and armor on the spot is pretty handy - but it is a good deal more than most villagers ever get, it's fairly versatile, and it can be used without destroying his disguise. It's also something that he can offer to teach new recruits. Besides, the small illusions - and the ability to deceive divination effects - both come in very handy in masking his true nature.
