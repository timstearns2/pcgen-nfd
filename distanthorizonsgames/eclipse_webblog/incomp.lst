Immunity/the distinction between weapons and himself	KEY:AnekBorez ~ 							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.AnekBorez		DESC: (Common, Minor, Major, Specialized in Swords, 3 CP). For true blademasters, their weapons are truly extensions of themselves; attempts to sunder or disarm them are simply treated as normal attacks against hem, and any touch-based powers and "unarmed" combat enhancements or martial arts which they may possess operate through their blades.

#  *
Innate Enchantment	KEY:AnekBorez ~ 							CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:EclipseAbilitiesOutput.AnekBorez		DESC:: 11,000 GP effective value, Specialized/all effects are represented by exotic sigils on the skin, his innate magics block the effects of spells and powers that would normally supersede the bonuses they grant, and adding or upgrading enchantments requires strange and exotic ingredients (6 CP).

#  *
# A great many campaigns will limit characters to 11,000 GP worth of Innate Enchantments - enough to grant characters some interesting and useful powers, and to make them considerably more likely to survive at lower levels, but not enough to make any really major changes at high levels. This batch of abilities would normally cost 880 XP to activate - but we don't really need to worry about that in an NPC.

# Blessings of the Darkness (24 CP).

# Long decades of service and honor as a mortal had earned Borez several blessings - some modest portion of the powers of a true Paladin. Of course - as often happens when a mortal finds such a path too difficult to follow and turns to darkness - the powers of the lower planes were more than happy to replace those lost blessings.

#  *
Luck with +4 Bonus Uses (12 CP).

# The Lure of the Night (Net 12 CP):

# This isn't a tremendous amount of power - although the ability to simply create his weapons and armor on the spot is pretty handy - but it is a good deal more than most villagers ever get, it's fairly versatile, and it can be used without destroying his disguise. It's also something that he can offer to teach new recruits. Besides, the small illusions - and the ability to deceive divination effects - both come in very handy in masking his true nature.
